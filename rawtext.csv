Even if you 'buy high' do not panic sell at a lower price.  Have patience.  If you really want out then set a limit order at the price you bought in at and it will get there.  This is not some shill coin and the price has a lot higher to go.  It may not be a day, a month, or a week before this coin rockets to the moon, but this time next year I bet the people who held through $15 are going to be laughing at themselves for even considering selling.

13,1514212949.0,"- Ethereum futures are coming really soon. The announcement of BTC futures alone pumped its price up to $20K in days, which was nuts.

- ETH is massively undervalued if you apply the same metrics to Bitcoin's price vs network usage

- Lots of new money will be entering the market after the holidays as people get their bonuses, money gifts, etc.

- ETH is primed for a pump to $1K+ levels, and when it does, it will create a new wave of FOMO.

tl;dr: go long Ethereum"

 Bytecoin is almost certainly an elaborate scam. Its blockchain appears to be mined in secret prior to 2014, meaning over 80% of the total supply is likely held, or at least originally held, by the coin's creators despite great attempts at the appearance of wider distribution. Nevertheless, Bytecoin introduced the Cryptonote protocol - a breakthrough in blockchain privacy - which spawned several other projects and forks that do not have controversial origins, such as Monero.

33,1514242757.0,"I see a few facts that assure me Bitcoin is not going to disappear
1. It's an industry...not a fad. This is it, cryptocurrency is here and will be around forever. This is just the beginning. 
2. Miner's control the industry...not the Bitcoin buyers/speculators. At this point there are hundreds if not thousands of companies that are now investing millions of dollars into mining cryptocurrency. They're not doing it with the expectation of it dropping to zero. Nor will they allow it. I know a husband and wife that were attorneys and closed their practice to buy servers that are now crowding their entire living room mining Bitcoin. When one blockchain is worth $250,000 the big boys take notice.
3. James Dimon threatens to fire employees that are trading Bitcoin..., that means there must be a ton of Traders trading Bitcoin. Traders trade to make money, not to lose it.
4. The Winklevoss twins became Bitcoin billionaires... there must be hundreds of Wall Streeters that have 10 to 50 million dollars that will do anything to be billionaires too. They're going to do everything they can to get a piece of the pie. They want to be billionaires far more than we want to be millionaires. We just have to ride their coattails.
5. The Wall Streeters are here to stay... these guys love volatile markets. They have computer software with algorithms that will make billions off of Bitcoin volatility. They're loving this ride
6. Twenty five coins awarded to miners... for each Bitcoin blockchain a miner gets  25 Bitcoins. This lasts till 2020 then it goes to 12.5 coins. Whatever they're worth today they will have to be worth twice as much in 2020 for minors to continue investing in servers to mine cryptocurrency. Right now people want to mine as much as possible before 2020 to maximize their ROI. 
7. Satoshi intentionally designed his code so that one Bitcoin would ultimately be worth $1,000,000....0.00000349 x 1,000,000 = 3.49.  I'm only assuming that he expected Bitcoiners to buy a burger for 349 micros. Otherwise the last digit has no value. 
8. Unfortunately we're at the beginning of the revolution. And that means there's going to be hell to pay for those that are part of the revolution. Governments will rise against cryptos, and only our children and children's children we'll see the full extent of cryptocurrencies success. We're going to get our asses kicked so we must stick together to win this revolution. 

In the end 21 million Bitcoins will be minted which means there's a potential for 21 million millionaires to be made. Being most people hold more than 2 Bitcoins, chances are there's only going to be a few million millionaires made. Stay in the game

Many Bitcoin men have been sent to jail and many more will follow. This is a movement for the common man, we must never give up. The future of generations around the world are depending on us to succeed.

I know I sound like I'm babbling but there's going to be a war over Bitcoin someday and we need to be strong in order to Win It...HODL"

146,1514407079.0,"**What is Bytecoin?**

Bytecoin is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin), private and untraceable cryptocurrency that was started in [2012](https://chainradar.com/bcn/transaction/9afeb29a9f3bd0d84c3d0081c47138c3a1cadd932215b59b146444ba6914e551). 

**Bytecoin** is the first coin that implemented [CryptoNote](https://cryptonote.org/) technology as a default aspect to build a project. Launched in 2012, Bytecoin was widely spread in the Dark Net as one of the popular available methods for payment. The main thing that separates Bytecoin from most of the other coins is total anonymity - as soon as your transaction appears on a blockchain, your address can’t be viewed by anyone. 

Bytecoin has shown a huge growth potential in all of its indexes. Since December 2016 the price per coin has [increased](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytecoin-bcn/) by 171 times and made over 17000% from growth to the early investors. During the project’s lifetime the amount of users has increased significantly. As of the beginning of December 2017 we have more than 20,000 loyal users (contributors, community enthusiasts, developers, broadcasters, etc.), so Bytecoin’s community is staying as one of the most talented and active ones. Today’s blockchain statistics are also spreading the word that Bytecoin is heading towards mainstream adoption - almost 1,500,000 transactions have been made according to Bytecoin’s [blockchain](https://minergate.com/blockchain/bcn/blocks).  

Bytecoin is the forefather of all of the [anonymous cryptocurrencies](http://mapofcoins.com/bytecoin#) based on CryptoNote technology. Here’s a list of the tech features and specifications Bytecoin has:

**Ring Signatures**

A [Ring signature](https://www.ccn.com/interview-harry-ullman-bytecoin/) is a special type of digital signature that can be created by someone from a group of users, but it is unknown who exactly the signer is. Imagine a letter that is signed by a group of 10 people. You know that one of them signed the letter, but there’s no way to identify who it actually was (you may only guess). This introduces the untraceability property, which means that for any Bytecoin payment there is a number of equal probable senders.

**Unlinkable Transactions**

Unlinkable transactions make the Bytecoin blockchain resistant to being scanned, which means it’s possible to see the details of a user’s transaction, but no one will know the sender or the recipient.

**Stealth Addresses**

With stealth addresses it’s not possible to know the sender and the recipient because of the outputs associated with certain addresses, moreover, it’s impossible to know who belongs to a certain output. 

The complexity of the features above makes Bytecoin absolutely unique. Moreover, Bytecoin’s Development Team has some ideas for the potential improvement of Bytecoin to make it even more anonymous and [reliable](https://bytecoin.org/blog/bytecoin-2018-roadmap-1,-2-quater). 

**Is it profitable to invest in Bytecoin?**

Investing in Bytecoin means: A. Investing in your anonymity, and B. Investing in a breakthrough technology. In fact, investing in Bytecoin seems to be one of the most profitable solutions in  2018 for one only obvious reason - today’s Bytecoin isn’t as widely spread as it is able to be, however, it has a huge potential. For now Bytecoin is only represented on 8 [exchange platforms](https://bytecoin.org/ecosystem), while it is possible to be listed in additional markets, the price has to increase significantly in order to help this come about so that new traders will be able to buy Bytecoins. In this case, investing in Bytecoin today will double your USD deposits by at least twice towards the end of 2018. Moreover, in December 2017 99,5% coins have been mined, which means the emission has to end soon (in about a year), which will definitely lead (according to the [economical model](https://bytecoin.org/about/what-is-bytecoin)) to a slight and stable price growth.

**Where can I buy Bytecoins?**

Here’s a list of the exchange platforms to trade BCN with different cryptocurrencies:

[Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). Available pairs: BCN/BTC and BCN/XMR.

[HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/).  Available pairs: BCN/BTC, BCN/USDT, and BCN/ETH.

[Stocks.Exchange](https://stocks.exchange/). Available pairs: BCN/BTC and BCN/ETH.

[AlCurex](https://alcurex.com/#BCN-BTC). Available pairs: BCN/BTC.

And a list of the platforms where you can purchase BCN directly with **FIAT** currencies:

[Changelly](https://changelly.com/). USD, EUR deposits with a bank card.

[Cryptonator](https://www.cryptonator.com/). Purchase Bytecoin with USD, EUR, RUB, and UAH via the Payeer payment processor.

[Coinspot](https://www.coinspot.com.au/). Direct purchasing of BCN with AUD.

[CoinBe](https://coinbe.net/ref/xmtarc). Direct purchasing of BCN with PLN.

Any other questions regarding this? Please, visit [this page](https://bytecoin.org/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-buying-bytecoin) to know more about buying Bytecoin.

**Where can I store my coins?**

There are several options on places to store your coins, starting from the exchange platforms which have inner wallets like [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), and [Cryptonator](https://www.cryptonator.com/). However, the most secure way to store your coins is to keep it in outside wallets. Here’s a list of wallet options to store your coins:

[Official Desktop Wallet](https://bytecoin.org/downloads). If you’ve faced some difficulties with setting up the wallet, take a look at the [instructions](https://bytecoin.org/docs/bytecoin-wallet-manual) or the [guide](https://coinwalletguide.com/bytecoin-desktop-wallet/).
 
[Official Web Wallet](https://bytecoin.money/#/login).

[Official Android Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bytecoin.bcn&hl=en).

[Bytecoin Android Wallet by Freewallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bcn.org.freewallet.app&hl=en).
 
[Cryptonator Wallet for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aev.cryptonator&hl=en). 

Choose the best option that is suitable for you and don’t feel shy to ask us for help when setting up your wallet. Please, understand that your wallet is a source where you store your funds. Take it seriously, use all the available protection methods (backups, mnemonics, 2FA, complicated passwords), but rely mostly on yourself and never forget your app credentials (keep them somewhere else except in your mind).

**How to check the current status of the available services?**

However, I think we can all agree that the fundamentals supporting Ethereum are absolutely amazing, and it's our best bet on determining it's true value.

SegWit never had consensus, it would never be activated if it wasn't put into a compromise of SegWit2x which was to add SegWit and then also 2MB blocks. The 2x never happened, and this new SegWit2x fork is NOT the same thing.

New SegWit2X on 28t Dec is completely different thing. it is 4MB blocks, different algorithm, 2.5min block times, replay protection and pre-mine of Satoshi's coins (which is equivalent to theft of Satoshi's coins). This fork is one big fat scam written all over it.

Now about Lightning, it is only P2P IF 2 persons create channel directly between one another, but in reality this will not be the case. LN will have users create channels to highly concentrated HUBs which will be acting as middle man in transactions. Miners are not middle men as miners do not send/recieve an funds while LN HUBs do. Also LN is a centralised system. Bitcoin is not. In order to create LN channel you must first open a channel which is written to Bitcoin blockchain, paying a fee as for any other transaction, then again pay fee for closing this channel. It is more expensive to create direct channel in LN then just use Bitcoin layer.

LN is not a solution to Bitcoin scaling, LN is not a Bitcoin system at all. Bitcoin is chain of digital signatures... SegWit broke that rule by taking out the signatures, SegWit is therefore an Alcoin fork of Bitcoin and not a Bitcoin system either.

Bitcoin Cash is the only working as intended, Bitcoin system. if you read the Bitcoin white paper you will see Bitcoin is meant to be used as digital money, not as store of value (also store of value alone does not exist, I have video on this topic also)."

Pros:

* Use any Ledger address
* Setting up and cancelling orders is free and instant
* Order book updates fast (no reloading needed)
* Order matching (it will pick orders until yours is filled and you have to confirm for each order that gets matched)

Cons:

* Maker orders also take a fee (0.2% depending on how much you trade)

My question is ...would Ether follow a similar trajectory? I want to diversify and I am looking at ETH, Aion, Eos and Tron/TRX at the moment.

From what I read all these seem to have value, Ether because does something different to Bitcoin, Aion because will be tool for scaling Ether and interoperate among blockchains, Eos for the huge transactional capacity, Tron as it is what Eth does but new.

It features real-time price updates, your customized portfolio, alerts, coin price comparisons and use lots of other cool tools and features. We believe that although there are several cryptocurrency tracking websites out there, there’s still something missing.

379,1514584854.0,"You didn’t go into *why* you believe bitcoin is a scam. 

Correct. Bitcoin has no assets. Neither does the USD. 

You’re comparing Bitcoin to stocks. It isn’t a stock. It isn’t a company. It is a currency. Just like the peso, dollar or yen. 

It is decentralized, meaning it is not run by a government. While, yes this means it does not have the “backing” of a government, and therefor could be viewed as risky, it also means it cannot be manipulated by a government. 

I would be happy to hear rational reasoning behind why Bitcoin is a “scam”. But your rationale of, “it has no assets” means you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about. 

Additionally, this video is maybe 1/3 about cryptocurrencies, the rest about pot penny stocks. This has no place in this sub. It barely has a place in the crypto currency sub. 

You offer no real analysis. You’re literally reading and speculating. From a place of uninformed opinions, and “research” done on Yahoo finance. 

TL;DR: Don’t give OP the ad revenue with a watch of this video. It’s total shit. Downvote and move on. "

I've been working on-and-off for the past several months on organizing a nonprofit organization to support private cryptocurrency projects. The organization's mission is to increase knowledge of and the significance of private cryptocurrencies through education, development, and research.

I would like the assistance of several community members to help me organize and register this group. Though the input of everyone is welcome, I especially need the assistance of people comfortable going public in the US. In my understanding, we need 5 people comfortable with registering their personal details to incorporate.

I have been approached by several people who would like to make tax-deductible contributions to private cryptocurrency education, development, and research. This organization will allow people to make these contributions, leading to an overall improvement in the space. It will function similarly to the Zcash Foundation. It will be completely separate from the Monero project directly.

If you are interested, send me a PM here on Reddit or on [Mattermost](https://mattermost.getmonero.org) (username: sgp). I would like to use a private Mattermost channel to organize discussion.

NOTHING to do with transacting anything via OMG. Secondly, these companies are Thailand based and Thailand is still very much a cash based economy, even most e-commerce payments are conducted via cash (ca. 80%). Offline merchants like mcDonalds are easily >95% cash payments. I'm not even sure if Omise handles offline POS credit card transactions. In that sense one should only check what % of sales of the merchants is online (note in Thailand roughly 2% of retail) and then only look at what % is non-cash (ca. 20%). I.e. Take 0.4% of the numbers reported here and consider what % of those can be captured by OMG. I'd say 2% in 5 years. So 0.02% of the numbers reported here.

*With these types of new digital assets security, custody is basically the key we all know what happened with some of the exchanges so the security of the assets of our users is our top priority. We have developed our own hot and cold security system that safely stores all these assets and it is very simple to use for the end user.*


*Some of these assets don’t offer multi sig wallets by themselves and that’s one of the systems we developed. Our system is like this: it goes from hot to cold based on the projected needs of these assets ever being to be moved. The lowest level is a multi sig contract with the highest number of participant or signatories required. They are all over the world and don’t know each other. This is the level we don’t expect to need to move often. There are some additional requirements based in to the smart contract that I cannot give out. So this is lowest level. As you go higher the criteria for security lowers. There are lower number of signatories in these smart contracts for the funds to move and when you get to the top you have some buffers for the small percentage of the total assets that basically insure the liquidity for the platform and these assets are controlled by the server and are naturally the most exposed. We solve this exposure with insuring them. So our hot wallets are insured so we have that covered and as you go lower all of these are done offline with hardware wallets, etc…*

*There are multiple levels of cold and hot storages and each of them is more or less complicated depending on the projection of how often those funds have to be moved.*"

Obviously a lot of us are here because we believe that the Decred PoS/PoW hybrid model (Based on PoActivity) is the most favourable system in regards to decentralisation, censorship resistance, autonomy and security.

The only other notable one for me would be pure PoW, both with ASICs and ASIC resistance. 

I am currently investigating further into DPoS systems so would appreciate any knowledge/opinions others had on those. Especially as I know there a lots of variations on that system.

So far pure PoBurn and PoCapacity don't seem serious problem solvers at all to me. And the basic architecture of PoS also doesn't really appeal to me but I haven't yet taken the time to read into, for eg. how exactly Ethereum or Cardano hope to implement, so I may still be very uninformed. "

As for dPOS -> I would say it degrades to 'sufficiently decentralized for most purposes'.  Take bitshares for instance .. there is a list of witnesses and several dozen waiting on standby which can be activated if one of the currently chosen ones does not come up to snuff.  May be easier to censor 25 geographically distributed (and instantly replaceable) server nodes, but maybe not... you usually run a light node (don't have to), but is this a problem if you already are prepared to trust exchanges or banks?..   In exchange for this tradeoff, you get tps in the thousands easily sustainable.

To summarize, dPOS in particular gives REAL performance increases but degrades many of the characteristics necessary to guard high value networks.  It is a really good tradeoff for platforms that must be 'active', e.g. smart contracts, DEX, etc, but I prefer my currencies to be a bit more hardened. "

We'll know more after Q4 report. Iconostat make the following assumptions:

1. All BTC & ETH on platform addresses are invested in DAAs (Possible that a large % of it is, but extremely unlikely *all* of it is).

2. Iconomi don't use those funds to buy underlying assets and instead use their own ETH / BTC. (Extremely unlikely given that most of Iconomi's ETH is tied up in the frozen parity wallet).

3. All BTC & ETH is invested in BLX paying 3% management fee with exit fee of .5%. (Not possible as we know other DAAs have several million AUM, therefore Iconomi fees will only be a fraction of the DAAs management fee. For example if GEM has $1m AUM, Iconomi will only get 1/3 of GEMs management fee)...

4. All funds that leave the platform deposit addresses are being withdrawn from DAAs, resulting in exit fees. This is extremely unlikely again because of point no.2.... Iconomi need to buy underlying assets so it's logical to assume they'll use deposits to do so...

But fast forward another few quarters and we'll be able to create much better estimates based on historical patterns. I'll personally be building something that will allow us to estimate fees and buybacks based on a number of variables.

There seems to be a recurring question as to how the DNT token can generate value to the individual that holds it. I see the Mods tirelessly trying to communicate this, and doing well at it. I get the concept (I think),  it is very clever, in addition, I think it is tricky to envisage how effective holding DNT will be until we are further down the roadmap and the token can be put to beneficial use (Accumulate! Accumulate! Accumulate!), however it did take me awhile and lots of reading, to get familiar with terminology and theory that drives the idea. 

I struggle to explain the concept however to the aveage Joe. 

Challenge:
What is the simplest analogy to explain the utility and thus value of the DNT token? 
Without using ""Staking Mechanism,"" ""Voting Rights,"" ""District,"" etc. what is a simple form you can explain the concept in? 

I think Brady describes utility with great clarity on the below link:
https://www.reddit.com/r/district0x/comments/7mlqdh/question_regarding_incentives/
But to give someone a brief effective description that will force them to dig deeper and read posts like the above, does anyone have any analogies?

I have thought about getting into mining crypto currency for some time now. Should have jumped on board back in 2013 when I first looked into it. I work in IT and I get all sorts of spare PC parts. I was just wondering what everyone here thinks about re-purposing old parts into mining rigs? For instance I currently have a few quadro k4000 3GB cards that just got swapped out for RX 580's. I know the k4000 isnt even half as powerful as a 580 but they are just sitting around. Is it worth the effort of assembling a scrape yard mining rig? I have so many parts just going to recycling im sure they have life left in them still.  "

I know WhatToMine is quoted often, but not only does it have Vega hashrates way wrong (for Monero, at least), it doesn't even list 1070TI and its estimated performance; thus, I can't consider it a de facto reflection of target hashrates.

Is there a resource that documents optimal Ether hashrates, with wattage, for all available cards in one handy list? Bonus points for comparing hash/watt at different performance levels - for instance, I've seen threads where folks have pushed RX 580s to 30.5 Mh/s at 150W, but 30 Mh/s at 120W.

Google searches reveal resources that are months old, or only provide stock numbers. I'm want to be able to compare up-to-date _target_ OC performance (hash/watt) numbers on 1070TI, 1080TI, RX570, and RX580."

Currently, the majority of live Decred tickets are staked at a very limited number of stakepools. Keeping this in mind, we felt the need to develop a low fee yet high quality pool that will further help with decentralization of the Decred network.

Our pool depends on multiple high quality servers distributed at points over 3 different continents and more than 13000+ kilometers apart. This will ensure that there are always multiple wallets online, ready to vote on your behalf whenever your tickets get called.


Pool’s features 

*  A low fee of only 1% !
*  Fully detailed tutorial (Video coming soon)
*  Detailed pool statistics 
*  Support through email or telegram available in three languages (English/Russian/Arabic)
*  Easy to access from any device 


***As part of our contribution to the decentralization of Decred, we will close registrations at our pool once its share of the network is at 15%.***

Your feedback is more than welcome. Also, If you have any feature that you would love to see implemented, please do not hesitate to tell us by commenting below or via email: decred@raqamiya.net.

Our team will take all suggestions into serious consideration, to help make your POS experience even better."

Being someone from the banking line, I know how tight the industry is regulated and how hard it can be for small producers and manufacturers to enter an official exchange. In my native country, you would need 2 million for the licences application and another 10-15 million as ready margin. This requirement itself made it not possible for small or even medium sized commodity users and manufacturers to enter. And we are not even talking about other unnecessary requirements.

We all have seen exchanges. Be it officially tied to an authorized exchanges or just on paper, it is readily available. But commodity exchange? Rare! Commodity exchange on blockchain? Very rare to non-existent! What Tudorpay is doing? I think it could be the first commodity exchange on blockchain that has a full end to end services.

So the question now is whether they will be able to raise enough funds and complete all the modules in time.

Some questions that could be totally off base:

* Is staking my token going to require processing power/electricty like a mining software?

* Is this something like a dividend? If so, What currency will this be paid out in?

* How do I stake my tokens?

974,1514994284.0,"1. If you stake using your own computer/server, it will take just the minimal amount of electricity that running your computer normally would anyway. It won’t guzzle the huge amounts of electricity like mining. That’s the whole point of proof of stake. It’s a way to make the network secure without burning millions of dollars of electricity per day. Instead, you are just putting up your tokens as a kind of “security deposit” as it were. Proof of work is basically “I’m willing to burn this much electricity so I’m trustworthy” whereas proof of stake is “I’m willing to put this much money at stake, so I’m trustworthy”

2. Because your computer is literally “working” for money, it can’t be called a dividend. Your computer is actively processing transactions and being paid fees, so “dividend” is the wrong word. The good thing about OmiseGO is it is currency agnostic, which means you can choose to be paid in whatever currency you like. USD, Bitcoin, anything.

976,1514994638.0,"I worked in VC the last two years, with early stage companies, and a precious insight (from my relatively small experience) is that great tech has no value without true business cases and vision driven team. OMG is all that. I've seen great tech teams fail more often that business case driven team. 

While tech has yet to go public, I'm confident they'll deliver on their promise based on the team of advisors' feedbacks. But what's strike me most is that OMG team has the business track-record and (above all else) relationships to have their great tech adopted massively. This is a very strong unfair advantage that almost only OMG has (if they are other crypto team that well composed, please let me know!!). 

That's why I believe OMG is the safest cryptoinvestment out there with extremely above average ROI potential. It's useless to comment on price point in 6 months, other than to estimate when you can shell out your initial investment, as this is a 2 years hodl at least. I'm not discouraging you to invest early in other coins but wouldn't hodl too long on most. 

Other coins may pump (say raiblock or cardano) but long term usage always prevails on tech capabilities, and you may make money acting like a trader. But this is not the behavior of an investor. Pumps are mostly instant gratification prospects driven. I'm extremely worried to see such massive influx of money without critical thinking. No professional investors would ever give (alone or jointly) 25m$ at skyrocketed valuation to team with no previous accomplishments, tech with no strong business ties, or even worse, at a pre-incubation dev stage. Not to mention that most people have no clue how we should value the tokens they purchase, nor do they analyze the needs for such solution or if it was tried in the past. It's not because it's blockchain based that it is necessarily better. Every startups start by solving a diehard problem that affect a great number of potential buyers. I see so many crypto projects that have no business value whatsoever or have already proved useless in the past (history repeats itself, we don't need crowdsourced space storage, or CPU power. People tried and the economics just doesn't match). When people start to realize that and come to their senses, it'll be a bloodbath on cryptos. Meanwhile there is money to be made on irrational, emotional and non-thorough wanna-be investors. 

There's an interesting correlation between cryptos and crowdfunding that can be made. Years ago, when crowdfunding trended, there was a lot of talk as how it would replace VC investors and give private individual opportunities to join the cash party. Years later, people came to their sense on it, with many projects failing to deliver because unrealistic from the start (from failed roadmap to teams with no business skills and so on... a video + good storytelling doesn't replace due diligence and assessing the team in investment). Crowdfunding is now either mostly use as a pre-sale and/or market testing option, or as a last resort for fundraising when founders have failed to convince professional investors (VCs, wealthy individuals, banks...). That says a lot about the project itself...

In 18 months from now, as heavily invested projects start to fail, I assure you people will have the same epiphany. Investment is a profession for a reason, it requires time, research & critical thinking, and should never be done on the fly. 

I like this community as it is the only sain (sometime too price optimistic but what the hell) crypto community I've seen so far.  "

1040,1515011898.0,
1041,1515012016.0,"Thank you for your questions. I have 2 more questions based on this passage from the same blog post: 

> users will be able to name their price when they submit a transaction, and validators are able to choose which transactions they pick up. Transactions with unreasonably low fees attached will find few or no validators willing to pick them up, and so will be slow to confirm or never confirmed at all. Validators trying to extract unreasonably high fees will find themselves with nothing to validate and therefore collecting no fees. Somewhere in the middle, reasonable people will be doing business based on fees that are equal parts practical for users and profitable for stakers.

1) First question, I'm not very worried, but the fact that users have to name their price, how will that be user-friendly? I believe one of the strengths of OmiseGO is simplicity and the fact that you don't know that you're using it, cause you're just making your transaction easily, but will that sort of bid game not slow down the process? Or will you make some sort of ""one bid for all"", name a fee price in your app, that you accept, and that will be available for all your transactions? I guess we don't know yet but I still wanted to point this question. 

2) More importantly, this post says you receive fees *if* the fees you ask for match with the fees users are ready to pay. Oppositely, OmiseGO is supposed to work with PoS, meaning that you just receive fees proportionally with how much coins you own. So how do both parts assemble together? Can you ilke stake 10000 OMG and not receive fees because you're asking 10% fees, while someone will receive more with 1 coin because he's asking for 0.01 % fees? What will finally decide how much you receive? If the matching happens on the individual level, I fail to see how you can maintain the PoS arbitrage. 

Does it mean that there some sort of ""masses"" (big batches) of matchings, for instance, ""all the users + validators matchings for fees at 0.5%"", and that, inside this batch, fees are divided between ""stakers having asked for 0.5%"" depending on their amount of coins?

I remember that the white paper talks about batches, but it was about conversion orders treated in batches, so I wonder if maybe something would be the same here…

Lights welcome. "
1042,1515012028.0,I'm excited about these five plans https://steemit.com/life/@thisisbenbrick/5-things-i-m-looking-forward-to-from-iconomi-in-2018
1043,1515012260.0,"I read the white paper but I didn't understand still certain points.
OmiseGO is an agnostic network which has its own blockchain (by Q2 2018) that deals with both cryptocurrencies and fiat money.
The owners of OmiseGO token will be rewarded for validating transactions (PoS).

Now I have some questions:

1. How can fiat money or other cryptocurrencies (es.ripple, bitcoin, ethereum) transactions be recorded on the OmiseGO blockchain? (They have already their networks/blockchain). Will be created on purpose a token representing them internally the OmiseGO blockchain?
Example:
If A pays B in dollars do the blockchain converts it temporally in Omisego (or the token created on purpose) before converting it in Chinese Yuan/other cryptocurrency/ or again in dollar? Or it gets recorded directly as transaction in the currency used?

2. Who will held the fiat currency or the cryptocurrency to permit the conversion of the token created on purpose? Or anyway to allow the money exchange? I know that it is decentralised but I don't understand how different currencies (especially fiat currency) could run outside of its network.

3. Who stakes how will be rewarded? Will them receive fiat money or a new cryptocurrency expressly created?

Excuse me If I screwed up something, but I want to understand deeply the issues that OmiseGO is trying to solve."
1044,1515014017.0,"1. I think you are talking about the decentralized exchange, not a blockchain. Currencies will be transferred using Ether as an intermediary. So in your example, you pay USD which is converted to Eth, then the Eth is converted to Yuan.

2. OmiseGO is currently working on securing billions of dollars of liquidity for the exchange through partnerships with big companies, so there will be many different currencies floating all about. The major currencies will not be in short supply.

3. That information hasn’t been released yet. My speculation is that we will most likely be paid in Eth, but that’s not for sure. Anyway, whatever we’re paid in, you can just use the DEX to exchange it for whatever currency you’d like, so I think it doesn’t really matter."

**Now we have**

* Profit sharing 
* Voting and 
* Paying fees
* Affiliates payed in ICN (just a guess but it´s the only solution that makes sense).

**My speculations of additional usages are:**

* Advertise your DAA on the platform (was kind of confirmed already)
* Create a public DAA (privates are free or at least cheaper)
* DAA tokenization
* DAA allowed to participate in ICOs (through Cofound.it)
* DAA manager payment in DAA tokens or optional ICN
* API trading quotas
* Custodial services (I don´t know the exact definition but it´s in the roadmap. Coinbase takes $100.000 just for setup + monthly fees https://custody.coinbase.com/pricing so it could be a big one)

It doesn't matter if you store your passwords in physical / offline locations if they are not strong and somebody can access your keystore file.  They need to be brute-force and dictionary attack resilient **in addition** to being stored offline/physically.

You say the passwords are in different physical locations, but is the *entire* password for any given address in a single location?  Maybe you should split up your passwords and only store 2/3rds of it in any one location so that you have better redundancy and security if any one location is compromised.

For security, you always want to be signing transactions on an offline air-gapped machine.  You can do this easily with a hardware wallet, or kind of fudge it by using a secure bootable OS on a USB (something like Tails Linux with network drivers disabled).

Are you checking the **entire** address before sending?  There exists malware that replaces addresses copied to the clipboard with malicious addresses that have the same first/last few characters.

1139,1515027875.0,"After describing my views about the potential markets of OmiseGO, [OmiseGo Potential Market Penetration Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/7mv27i/omisego_potential_market_penetration_analysis/), I wanted to complete research on how OmiseGO is currently adopted by companies and how it will be implemented on a Global Scale. Such as with the last post I made, this is all hypothetical with assumptions that were backed with information, I am not trying to spread rumours. Majority of the information provided is information that I have been questioned by friends and colleagues on the subject. Any feedback on this information is welcomed and can strengthen the overall knowledge of how OmiseGO will be adopted over other solutions.  
&nbsp;

**Current Adoption**

As we all know from Jeremy Lam’s Blog Post, [Fuseki Milestone and Cash In Cash Out Details](https://blog.omisego.network/omisego-update-fuseki-milestone-and-cash-in-cash-out-details-f2eada1fdc2f), that the “OmiseGO SDK is in the hands of one of our strategic partners, a huge multinational company that will help us develop one of our first live use cases.” 

From the above it is evident that Omise is working with a multinational company (Company that operates in multiple countries) that most likely has roots in various markets across South East Asia. I believe this is the most important news that was released. Instead of their SDK Wallet being provided to a local company that only does business in one country, they are already working with a company that deals with multiple countries and currencies. This will provide the best use case for the OmiseGO Network by seeing how the wallet works by crossing borders.  
&nbsp;

**Which Partner is Creating the Use Case?**

The above is understandable that they do not want to release who the multinational company is until certain conditions are met, but with current information we can deduce the following from their [Crowd Sale Document](https://cdn.omise.co/omg/crowdsaledoc.pdf)

They mention that their Global Conglomerates are:

-	SBI Holdings
-	Mizuho Bank Ltd.

As they have mentioned these companies in their Crowdfunding Whitepaper on June 19, 2017, it could be deduced that they have worked continuously with these companies. As well allowing one or more to test the Beta for a potential use case, before releasing any information. Majority of individuals within this subreddit believes it is Mizuho Bank Ltd., but we won't know until more information is released.  
&nbsp;

**Future Adoption – Surpassing Current Adopters**

The main storyline that I see on this subreddit from time to time is J-Coin, and on whether this is potentially OmiseGO. From my viewpoint, I believe J-Coin will be a new cryptocurrency and not related to OmiseGO. However I believe the reason the banks are creating J-Coin is to eventually use the OmiseGo network and transition to a digital currency as a whole for the country of Japan.

[J-Coin News Artical](https://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Currencies/J-Coin-Japanese-banks-virtual-currency-without-the-volatility)

Since OmiseGO, as a cryptocurrency, is volatile, no bank will adopt a cryptocurrency that is decentralized due to the large swings in value. The solution the banks have is to create a cryptocurrency that is centralized and holds a mirrored value to their currency, in this instance the Yen. In this scenario you could effectively transition funds accross accounts(Savings, Chequing, and Crypto) and exchange at a 1 to 1 ratio. Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. is the parent company of Mizuho Bank Ltd., which is one of our strategic partners. As mentioned above, **IF** Mizuho Bank Ltd. is the company creating the use case for the OmiseGO network, it would provide a starting framework to work alongside the implementation of J-Coin. 

The important things to note, is that once Japan issues their own cryptocurrency based on the value of their current currency, other countries may follow suit. I believe in the coming years more countries will make the same transition, which allows the OmiseGO network to be utilized more effectively and aids the Cash In/Cash Out Implementation. Further the network can be used in more countries and will effectively increase how much money actually passes through the OmiseGo Network.  
&nbsp;

**Staking Requires Continuous Adoption**

Lastly I wanted to discuss the Adoption of Staking for OmiseGO, which will be based off this blog post, [OMG Network Staking Returns](https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-staking-returns-5744a23f4569). The main importance that Omise is trying to accomplish, is to ensure there is a large quantity of individuals who are staking on the network.

Therefore in order to ensure staking is attractive for individuals on the network, Omise is doing two things that are important, which also helps them build revenue for the company, where the second is often overlooked. 

1. Finding companies to use their network once it goes Live.  
2. Provide consulting in creating the companies E-Wallet.

In the blog post it mentions that after their business transitions into using the decentralized exchange their two sources of income will be their staked tokens, that they currently have, and consultancy work in order to attract more businesses to use their network. Thinking of the potential, Omise will want companies to adopt OmiseGO because they can provide guidance to these companies in order to create their digital wallet. With these companies adopting the network and having a functional digital wallet program, Omise will obtain rewards from increasing the networks use through staking. Their work in attracting businesses will not end once the network goes live, they will use their use cases to attract more businesses and grow the network continuously. It is in their best interest to have more businesses adopt as that will increase their overall profit. Therefore as an individual I would not worry too much in regards to the staking rewards, since Omise will continue to attract businesses.

In actuality, you can even think further into the future that with their SDK Wallet model is similar to that of Shopify. Shopify aids companies to move to an online environment by providing tools and information to better grow their business. Instead of creating the companies e-commerce platform, Omise will be helping create their mobile payment platform with their SDK Wallet. Omise will effectively pivot into providing a service that will help companies move into the digital currency age with ease.   
&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

Omise will be constantly working alongside the corporations they already have in place, which we will be able to see a use case for the network in the coming months. Long term adoption of digital currencies is currently moving in the correct direction with countries considering moving to a digital currency. This move by countries will interact beautifully with the OmiseGO network for Cash In/Cash Out Implementation. And lastly, Omise will require individuals to stake tokens in order for the network to be functional and will continue to support OmiseGO by getting more companies to use their SDK. They not only gain revenue from staking their tokens, but can gain revenue by consulting on new E-Wallet platforms for these businesses.  
&nbsp;


This has been something that was on my mind recently regarding the next stages of Omise and OmiseGO. The next few months will be exciting in how we will interact with the system with regards to staking, actually using the network, and the decentralized exchange functionality. If you have questions or if I have stated something incorrectly, please let me know. I would love to hear your opinions on this information to better enforce or change my views."

A few notes about my current setup: I am using the native desktop wallet for MacOS. My mac is a 13"" macbook pro 2015.

I do not open up every single wallet I have on my desktop, every single day. Sometimes I do not even touch my computer for days. When I do need to go open up one of the wallets (or more than 1) it takes a while to syncronize the blockchain(s), and my laptop heats up and the fans turn on.

I am trying to minimize the time needed to sync when I launch the apps.

I generated a signed transaction on an offline device and have previously used the ""Send / Publish Transaction"" section on https://www.myetherwallet.com/#offline-transaction but it doesn't seem to be working today.

1277,1515045985.0,"Most of Reddit, and other mediums of information exchange focused on blockchain/cryptocurrency, is peppered with references to ""mooning"", ""going to the moon"", or ""finding your moon"". This is usually in reference to a particular cryptocurrency, utility token etc. skyrocketing in price and making everyone involved rich. It is incredibly exciting to be involved in this rapidly growing yet nascent space and it is fun to make lots of money trading, but it is important to see the bigger picture.

I've read more than a few posts in the past few days from people ""finding their moon"" and cashing out with a simple ""thank you"". While I am happy for these individuals, I truly hope that their involvement in this movement continues beyond their recent windfall. We need help promoting, teaching, and expanding blockchain tech so it can realize its full potential.

I recently ""found my moon"" when I was hired by a blockchain startup last week. I have no development skills at all. I worked tech support for a few small startups and have been a freelance artist and marketer for the last ~5 years. I still trade and hodl a few cryptos and I hope to make good gains from those, but the real goal is to be a mover and influencer for the greater good of blockchain.

Why stay here on earth while your coins go to the moon? You can go there yourself. The blockchain world needs marketers, attorneys, salesmen, support reps, artists, and teachers. This is no longer an esoteric world for developers only. We need people from all disciplines to work to create a strong blockchain ecosystem and drive adoption. I hope newcomers to the space see beyond the $$$$ and find an opportunity to use their skills to help in other ways.

And since the key never ever leaves TREZOR, it cannot be accessed in any way.

Sometimes I get asked what I mean when I say ""good hunting."" Sometimes I get asked how to hunt. I’m usually silent. Today, that changes a little.

I’m not sure everyone around here will believe me if I say that I want everyone who follows this sub to be good at “hunting” and to have good hunts.  I don’t kind of mean that, I really mean it. It’s why I post these charts and write all this stuff for you to consume. But specifically, I mean a lot of other things when I say “good hunting,” too. Today I'm going to share a little more about what that means.

You'll notice that I never say ""good luck."" ""Good luck"" is for assholes and gamblers. That's not what we're doing. Instead, we're trying to figure out how to find the best available opportunities. We’re going to have method in the way we do that and we’re going to be sporting about it. We’re going to hunt.

And then, out of nowhere comes all this XRP shit. 

This, the alt surge last summer and the present alt surge, all made sense when it was happening with Eth. That's not a full endorsement of Eth as an investment. It just means that it's a project that doesn't have its head up its own ass. Some people say Bitcoin has its head up its ass for various reasons... but it's simple for me to argue against them and it should be for you, too.

Today, many users basically asked ""Why all the hate on alts."" Simply put, **security**, and it's just not ""good hunting"" when you win because you got lucky and made a good pick. That's just good luck and it makes you an asshole. So, shut the fuck up about your good luck. Nobody cares, and that's not what we do around here. It’s not good for the game, and its’ not good for your mind. Take your winnings and go to the beach, but don’t hang around here and bitch at us because we don’t want to talk about your lucky pick with you.

If you're smart, and I know you are, then  you're still asking, ""but why?""

I'll digress.

##Why?

###Scenario 1

Let's talk about Bitcoin Barbra (BB). BB likes money and cracking. BB is good at it, too. To BB, Bitcoin, the protocol and the wallets that contain large sums of bitcoin, are a giant honey pot. BB doesn't have to work, because she already has a lot of bitcoin, and mining hardware. All the money just flows in, and she can do whatever she wants. Some time ago, though, BB noticed that she wasn't making any progress using her resources to crack open bitcoin. So, she decided it would be more fun and profitable to go after projects that don't know as much about what they're doing.

###Scenario 2

While BB is cracking away on a recent litecoin fork Jamie Diamon (JD) is evaluating the blockchain for possible use at his bank. JD mulls over the technology and decides that he can create his own implementation that handles international transactions more efficiently and securely than the current banking model. 

When JD goes to his IT security guys with this one of them mentions his friend BB, who would love to snatch transactions from CHASE and pwn JD. 

JD thinks about it and says he'll ""just hire the best people in the industry to pwn BB."" Then the ITSec guys all say that those guys are already working on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and that those people all hate him. BB hates him too. Everyone hates JD, even his own ITSec guys.

JD decides that Bitcoin is ""fucking stupid"" and bitches about it whenever someone brings it up.

##How?

Security is maintained by the hash rate and the development teams that commit changes to the project. There aren't a lot of those resources to go around and they stay focused on the best most profitable options.

##In Conclusion

Basically, when you buy alts, you're being an uniformed JD, in almost all cases. At least JD knows to ask his ITSec guys and to stay the fuck out of it. There are some good projects out there, but you must be relatively informed to see past the marketing and BS.

The alt that surges next will always be a gamble, but when the reckoning comes for it there will be a storm that will never resolve itself. Research the DAO... and that's Ethereum, which I **do** think is a good project. None of the other alts even come close. 

That DAO shit will never happen to Bitcoin. know why? because it's best in class, by far. Bitcoin Core doesn't fuck up. It just doesn't. Last fuckup happened just after Satoshi disappeared, and that was the last one. Nobody but core ever knew enough about it, either.

Transaction malleability bug is probably the last ""whoopsie daisy"" we'll see from core.

When you bet on other coins you need to recognize all the risks involved. Security is almost always forgotten in that process. Also, consider that as security features are added to bitcoin vulnerabilities are exposed in alts. As this space develops the hacks against alts will increase in intensity and frequency, and the hackers will be using knowledge that has been discovered and proven by Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin doesn't face attackers armed with more knowledge than the team already possess. No other team can be sure of that. Maybe Eth, but that's more of a spectrum issue. The avenues of attack against Eth are much wider and more varied.

Also, it's impossible to know when and which alt will implode/explode. So, just stay the hell out of it.

###Principles:

* Buy assets with real and identifiable quality
* Understand what it is you are buying
* Sell assets that have no discernable quality
* Sell things you don’t understand
* Do not trust marketing
* Follow your plan

**Good hunting**

1382,1515056061.0,"The question in slack came up about what the difference would be between reddit here and the stack exchange site.

The way I see it is that reddit is for more general discussion and can include more targeted discussion from time to time as well, but is much more loose in terms of subjectivity.  Stack exchange, on the other hand, is much more focused on concise and objective questions and answers.  There is very little room for subjectivity on stack exchange.  It's primarily for more technical questions such as the specifics of how certain features work as opposed to tutorials on how to use said feature which is better suited for reddit/youtube/docs.

You might see questions here on reddit such as where do you think the price will be in 1 year which, so long as it doesn't overrun the subreddit, is acceptable.  That same question on stack exchange would not be acceptable because it calls for speculation and therefore is purely based on subjectivity which disqualifies it from being an objective source of solid facts and information.

Another example would be if you want to know precisely what happens the moment you submit a proposal to Politeia on the backend, that would be best suited for stack exchange.  If you want to know how to submit a proposal, that's better for reddit.

Hopefully that helps clarify the distinction."
1383,1515056154.0,"Questions on ""Privacy"" and ""Staking"" of OmiseGo.

1. Are transactions on the OmiseGo network ""private""? Since some transactions are sensitive such as Payroll deposit or when a business pay a particular supplier. They wouldn't want anyone to know how much they are paying.

2. Why do we need staking in place (PoS) or for that matter PoW? can't the system validate itself by some kind of algorithm ? If the answer is: system need people running the nodes to reach consensus, then would staking OMG tokens will require people running a node as well? If yes, then I guess we would need quite a large hard drive to store all the Blockchain data ?

1426,1515059399.0,"I have a pretty crazy theory that I want to share but hopefully I won't break the record for downvotes in the process. 

I have been thinking for a while that something seems suspicious about the way the market has been moving lately. Isn't it strange how most of the coins pumping are all ""cheap"" as in they are less than $10 per coin? Isn’t it strange how the crypto market cap grew by $58 billion today, but Bitcoin’s market cap did not change at all? Then I had a realization. What if everyone is being played by a greater power.  If you don’t like conspiracy theories stop reading now.

Everyone has been justifying the altcoin surges as Bitcoin taking a rest and dumb money chasing “cheap coins”, but what if it is actually institutional investors using alt coins in order to accumulate Bitcoin. It makes a lot of sense. If you look at the dates the surges started 

* XRP - December 8
* XLM - November 27
* IOTA - November  6
* ADA - November 27
* XEM - December 8

The futures trading press release went out on December 1, but what if some people knew that it would be approved ahead of time? If you are an investor with deep pockets you have a problem. You want to be able to bet on Bitcoin’s future price, but you don’t own enough Bitcoin to be able to manipulate the market (it is much easier to gamble when you control the outcome). You need a way to accumulate.  Articles start to hit the press about how a small group of whales control a huge amount of the supply of Bitcoin and that makes it dangerous, etc. Big players are trying to convince people that Bitcoin is not a safe investment. Lots of bubble talk spreads. Jim Cramer says you are better off going to Vegas than buying Bitcoin.  It doesn‘t scare the public away.

These investors are usually the ones who get first stab at new assets. They get to invest early in companies, they get first stab at IPO shares when a company goes public, but with Bitcoin they are late to the party. How are they going to accumulate? They aren’t stupid. They realize that driving the price of Bitcoin down too much to buy cheaper will scare people away from the market, and there is a limited amount of downside (it can only go as low as $0), but there is an infinite amount of upside. They also don’t own enough Bitcoin to crash the market that far.  So what do they do?

The answer is: find alt coins that are “cheap”. They know that if someone has to choose between a $15,000 dollar coin and a $1 coin they will choose the $1 coin every time. It is a psychological thing. Everyone just looks at the price and believes that $1 coin can also go to $15,000 one day.  So if institutional money starts to buy up huge amounts of these “cheap coins” and gets the general public on board, they can then accumulate huge amounts of Bitcoin without the Bitcoin price changing at all because alt coins trade against Bitcoin! If you want to quadruple the amount of Bitcoin you have, it is much easier to pump up a smaller coin and sell it, than it is to drive down the Bitcoin price 4x to accumulate more for the same amount of USD.

Take a look at some of the headlines lately. I suspect the press releases are also coordinated:

* RIPPLE to become the new BITCOIN? Surge in new cryptocurrency as banks FAVOUR it 
* Bitcoin latest: Ripple’s XRP is best-performing cryptocurrency with 380-fold increase in 2017 
* Bitcoin price WARNING: The cryptocurrency will burn out in SPECTACULAR CRASH
* Bitcoin is Akin to Gambling, Causing Egypt to Ban It

In addition to these alt coin surges, every time Bitcoin looks like it is going to break out a new sell wall appears and some market selling into the buys begins to drive the price back down. To me this is a very well executed effort to hold down Bitcoin’s price while accumulating more by pumping alts. I noticed earlier today a $1 million buy wall on XLM that was moving up as the price increased. Is that how a normal person would buy up XLM? It is possible, but I doubt it.

I know it seems wild, but if this theory is correct then it means at some point there will be a pretty fantastic dump with alt coins and a giant surge for Bitcoin.

Of course, I could also just be thinking crazy thoughts.

1454,1515061548.0,"good post , I largely agree. I made a similar comment myself and got the typical conspiracy comments, probably from the whale's shills themselves.

but basically yes, there is a conspiracy. The rbtc crew, was always mostly banker shills wanting to see bitcoin be taken out. throw in few dozen buttcoin trolls who are at this point invested in a bitcoin crash/failure. they were aided by useful idiots such as ver and wu. wu had his own asicboost agenda of course.

Then once btc broke 10k, the banks had to something @ this point ( or so they felt),and get involved in the bitcoin attack in some way. this did increase the shills even furthermore. 

we saw the daily thread really get overrun by shills around mid summer, still as bad as its ever been. you want a good example of this check out the daily threads from the week long consolidation around the 7900-8200 price range.

also you had wall street converging on the scene @ the same time. wall street was pissed off that they even had to be involved in crypto at all, so they bought the minumum in bitcoin and began to look to alts to attack bitcoin.

And yes ,the mainstream media even got involved in the fudding. 
and yes the ripple pump is and attempt to, its basically the banks admitting, OK sure crypto is here to stay, BUT lets switch to ripple if we have to use crypto. and there was literally 20 billion + that went into buying ripple. that was the big banks show of force, it pumped so hard it passed ethereum. ripple is the bank coin, thats who pumped it. and likely it was backroom type situation, where the big players came to ripple and said look we will pump your coin if you give us a stake, say 5 or 10% whatever it was. call it a conspiracy but this is what really happened.
ripple and bcash situations are the same, just different players behind it.

so it was basically all of those forces converging, note that all of them have illegitimate intentions. None of those coins pumped for the original reason bitcoin did, because people liked it and wanted to use it.

so sure you can pump ripple and bcash up to 50 or 100 billion, but at the end of day you just have a bunch of whales bagholding, waiting/hoping for bitcoin to break. they are patient and we really have not seen almost any pullback of significance in these pump coins.

1489,1515064392.0,"I have whales on twitter that purposefully accumulate penny coins until they own around 80% of the market, then start doing small pumps to get some FOMO going to then dump them at 50%+ increase. Well when I say dump they dont drop them all at once near the top, people buy into their sell walls on the way up.

These small individual whales aren't doing the big coins in the top 20 but there's nothing stopping HUGE whales doing it or multiple whales working together.

Check out https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/everex/

This is whale market moving. I have the guy doing it on twitter, it's pretty nuts.

I personally believe a lot of the parabolic movement in the top coins is initiated by whales, it's just way to coincidental that different coins at different times suddenly go into full FOMO out of the blue, but seemingly in the same pattern and in the same short space of time. Before this correction it was plain to see.

It's a fact that small markets are manipulated, its not a stretch to say the big ones are too, the possibility of heavy manipulation not occurring seems very very small."

1509,1515065896.0,"The reason I bring this up is that I see people talking about buying 5-10 miners with what seems like no thought into how they intend to power the setup. The talk about running multiple miners in apartments. . . and the fact that many of the setups I've seen on YouTube are bordering on if not are outright fire hazards. 

Each miner draws somewhere between 750-1000w per miner depending on model. Most of the discussion is on Antminer L3+ units which draws 800w so I'll focus on this model. 

A 120v 15amp circuit at 80% has a max permissible wattage load (1800w -20% safety factor) of 1440w. What this means is that you can run 1. I repeat 1 miner on a single 15amp circuit. Because in most homes all outlets in a single area of a home will be wired to a common circuit this means you can't simple plug a half dozen miners into wall outlets. 

So lets talk about what you can do. In most areas its not difficult to find 30amp single pole breakers. Max load on a 120v30amp breaker is 3600w - 20% safety = 2880watt. A single 30amp 120v circuit will support 3 miners that aren't overclocked. It's also not a bad idea to be monitoring the actual wattage draw. Compared to a 30amp 220v circuit which supports (6600w - 20%) 5280w you can see why running these devices on 220v is preferable. The wattage limit on a circuit of a given amp rating is doubled. This means that 6 can be run on a single 30amp 220v circuit. Two wires carrying the load instead of 1. 

For those living in an apartment you'll need to determine what kind of service your unit has (100amp service is the most common). 60amp is 10560w max and 100amp is 17600w. So when you start talking about running 10 miners in an apartment that only has 60 or 100amp service this can be a problem when you still need to run all of your appliances/heat and its especially so if there are only a couple of open slots on your panel. 

My own personal setup is that I have 100amp service to a detached garage. I have 15 L4+ miners arriving next week. I have a single 70amp 220v circuit wired with 4gauge wire (this is good for 100amp) to a sub panel and 3-30amp 220v circuits wired each with 5 outlets. This gives me some wiggle room on wattage to overclock until I can get 400amp service brought into the garage in spring. I did this install myself so its not difficult. Total draw of the miners is less than 12000w and all other combined sources of power (garage door opener/lights) do not exceed 5000w so I'm safely under the 17600w limit of 100amp service. 

So do the math: Watts/Volts = Amps. (Volt * Amp)*.8 = Max Wattage. Don't forget that you still need to power the rest of your electrical needs. Then size your wires accordingly and for the love of God don't splice an extension cord for this purpose. They are usually at best 12awg wire and in most cases 18awg. 

Wire Gauges: Consult your local laws but here are some general guidelines. 
20AMP: 12AWG
30AMP: 10AWG
40AMP: 8AWG (NM, TW & UF wire)
50AMP: 8AWG (SER Cable)
55AMP: 6AWG
100AMP: 4AWG

1545,1515068441.0,"Reposting and deleting the old comment since I forgot about the new Daily being created:

I've noticed a slight bleed in BTG and BCH over the past few days as the alt-mania has reached a fever pitch. Even I sold some of my remaining BCH (only keeping it as a hedge) to buy some Top-25 alts merely for profit as I think almost none of them are justifiably worth this much. As others have pointed out, many of these alts are going completely parabolic, and I'm of the opinion it's purely greed akin to the dotcom bubble. All of what I'm saying has been said before, but I want to throw my two bits in that I think the alt-reckoning is drawing near. It's becoming too easy to make a profit on these alts that essentially offer nothing. Bitcoin's fear is starting to wear off as technicals and fundamentals are beginning to point towards higher prices again. I think a lot of people are about to get burned and a lot of that profit is coming back to the honeybadger.

I've seen [this paper](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) posted a few times and finally got around to reading it. It took about an hour as I kept getting distracted, but it's extremely well-written and anyone invested or considering investing in Bitcoin should read it as the points brought up make a lot of sense. I almost gave up reading it a few times in the first few pages as the technical language seemed a bit dry, but by the end, I was extremely glad I stuck with it. It perfectly explains the logic of the Core dev team for pursuing a digital gold approach, and details why many of these alts are not worth anywhere close to their current market caps. Hell, how many billion dollar unicorns do you read about in the real economy like Uber et al? Yet we have 36 cryptos, the majority of which have barely proven their worth if at all, worth upwards of a billion at time of writing this comment. The true value is in digital gold that will likely become an international reserve asset in the next decade. Payment channels and alts will likely eventually be implemented as sidechains, revealing all of these altcoins for what they are, silly money grabs. Don't lose faith in the honeybadger, guys, it's merely been biding its time and taking a healthy breather on it's way to $100k+ instead of going straight for the moon with no consideration for the space debris in its path like these other coins.

After careful thought, I no longer expect $8k imminently. Instead, I expect $15.4k to break in the next week if not the next day, $16.5k to be tested for a short time, the alt house of cards to begin to collapse, and our ATH to be tested and broken in the next few months depending on how long we consolidate. Of course any ETF announcements, black swan events (war), or alt manipulation (XRP ""surpassing"" the BTC market cap) could change this timeframe, but we shall see."

And again Ripple saw MASSIVE losses in 2015 and 2017 only to bounce back to the old btc/xrp ATH. And don't forget it's even been the case with Monero during the 2016 and 2017 pumps.

A law firm from Seoul has decided to address arbitrary measures taken by authorities to regulate cryptocurrency trade. Korean lawyers have filed an appeal accusing their government of “unconstitutional” infringement on property rights. Newly imposed rules are devaluing virtual currencies, they say.

Order! Constitutional Court to Decide
Anguk Law Offices filed their appeal through the Constitutional Court’s online system at the end of December, The Korean Times reports. Regulating the trade of cryptocurrencies through administrative guidance has no legal grounds, its justification reads. “We agree that regulations are necessary. But they should come after related laws are implemented”, lawyer Jeong Hee-chan said, quoted by the newspaper. Jeong and his colleagues also called for the government to respect the property rights of its citizens and regulate only after reaching a social consensus.

The Seoul-based firm believes ministers are exerting “unconstitutional” authority through regulations on cryptocurrency trade introduced last month. The measures were meant to control Korea’s coin trading frenzy in a year that saw Bitcoin reaching $20,000 USD. The south of the divided peninsula is a major cryptocurrency hub hosting large-scale exchange operations.

The recent market explosion presented new challenges to Korean authorities and they attempted to dampen crypto markets. The government discussed measures to deal with growing cryptocurrency speculation and local exchanges were forced to revise policies in order to comply with new regulation. A system to enforce identity verification of cryptocurrency traders should be implemented around January 20, preventing anonymous trading.



It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over
With the new regulations, Seoul has attempted to prevent exchanges from opening virtual bank accounts for traders. The government has insisted on implementing “real-name” policies to verify personal details of account holders. The stated goal being “to deter money laundering and other illegalities”. Cryptocurrency exchanges in the country have largely complied with changes to restrict certain traders and end the “virtual accounts” practice that helped them manage clients’ money more easily.

Currently, the South Korean government does not recognize bitcoin and other cryptos as legitimate currencies. They are not considered financial products either. Well, since financial law is not applicable to the digital coins, they should be perceived as commodities and traded freely, the smart lawyers claim. They admit cryptocurrencies are not legal tender but then a crypto could only be a property or an asset. And assets can be exchanged with legitimate currencies or other goods.

It doesn’t stop there: Anguk Law Offices went even further, accusing the government of devaluing coins by creating obstacles to trading. “Thus, this is an infringement on people’s property rights by unlawful measures”, the law firm said in a statement. It is also preparing a series of follow-up appeals filed by cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. Lawyers have also expressed real concerns that “the government is likening investors’ success to a morally reprehensible speculation without sufficient review of it… It is very worrisome!”

2) Leave it on, hoping that heat melts any snow before it gets too close, but at risk of intake fan ingesting snow / moisture

1577,1515071061.0,"I downloaded the coinmarketcap.com data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies as of a couple hours ago ([source](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/)) and did some charts of which coins gained the most in the last 7 days. Note: These are not weighted averages but I doubt that makes any difference.

[Top 100 CMC coins by price](https://i.imgur.com/rjW9rTl.png)  
Here we're sorting by price-per-coin from the most expensive coins (BTC, BCH, DASH, ETH) to the least expensive (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's a pretty clear trend here that the expensive coins are up a little bit, but the cheaper the coin is the more likely it is to be up a huge amount.

[Top 100 CMC coins by circulating supply](https://i.imgur.com/aha3LX3.png)  
This is sorted by the total number of coins in circulating supply, from fewest (GBYTE, GNO, BTCD, DGD) to the most (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's an even clearer trend here that the coins with smaller total supplies are up a little bit, but the more coins circulating the more likely that coin is to be up by a lot.

[Top 100 CMC coins by market cap](https://i.imgur.com/PXMjTeM.png)  
This is the top 100 coins by the value of their total market capitalization from lowest (WTC, POE, BLOCK, ITC) to highest (BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH). This time there's basically no trend. The coins with the highest market caps are up just about as much as the lowest market cap coins, and it's fairly random inbetween.

I'm neither a statistician nor a market analyst but this looks like pure market irrationality to me. The best recent predictor here for market performance of a coin is simply the size of its circulating supply, which is essentially a meaningless decision about where to put a decimal place. Satoshi could have just as easily capped bitcoin at 21 billion coins instead of 21 million, and maybe if he did the BTC market cap would be much higher because people would perceive it as ""seeming cheap"".

We're in a bull market and nearly everything has been up, so there's a lot of FOMO and throwing money at anything that moves. If this was the stock market I would knowingly tap the side of my monocle and say ""Oh ho, fundamental valuations will catch up to you in the end, and then you'll be sorry you didn't do your due dilligence."" In crypto, however, I've seen little evidence so far that fundamental valuation ever catches up to anybody.

1621,1515074552.0,"Just think back to when the whole ETH rally started in the summer. Bitcoin was what, around 1400 on May 1st. Lets look at just the rally itself. If you bought BTC on May 1st and held til mid June, you would have made 127% on your money. If you had bought ETH, you would have made 760% by mid June.

Now, lets go back to May 1st. On this very day, on Bitfinex, ETHBTC is shorted to 0.0098 in a flash crash at 3 PM UTC, at a low price of 0.0098 btc per Eth. If you were to have accumulated those orders at the bottom of that candle, you would have been able to ride the rally in ETHBTC for a 1464% gain in BTC. Even someone who didnt get flash crash prices would be able to ride a 200% gain buying on the next daily candle.

Lets look where the big play happens. Some clever fellow shorts the shit out of ETHBTC in particular, using BTC as collateral. Whoever gets in on this play accumulates quite a line in ETH. They sell the ETH in June, which sees a drawdown over the next month to 30% of its 400ish top by mid July. BTC also has a drawdown, but only to 61% of its top. 61% of 1464% is still 893%. 61% of the aforementioned 200% is still 122% up. Lets look at what that means for the holder of bitcoin who got in on this play. The worst case scenario is that they more than doubled their money *after the drawdown*. Their overall cost basis for the bitcoin they purchased is less than half of what it used to be. The risk/reward for staking this quantity of money on margin is now too good to pass up, because they have doubled their collateral. And that's someone who converted straight back to BTC. What about the person who went to fiat and had no drawdown, and accumulated a line of BTC throughout the bear market?

Knowing this, is it any surprise that we had seen such a huge rally of BTC by the end of the year? Follow the money. These cycles have everything to do with accumulation and distribution of positions by people with huge accounts that can move markets. Nothing is different now than it ever has been other than the volumes of money pouring in."

1638,1515075481.0,"I have been playing with lightning the last few weeks, and have been thinking about how *I* want to use it. And how I would *like* my Trezor to be part of it :) Feel free to take my ideas a part, critizise them, point out weaknesses or build on them.

First: My trezor will never be always on, and I do not want my keys to be active without me confirming it. But I still think some lightning interaction might be useful.

I use the web wallet for now, as for me this has made most sense. It was early to use Segwit, and has the features I need in a hardware wallet.

I think I will never use only my trezor/hardware wallet. I am currently using Samourai for my spending wallet, but will probably switch to the first one that supports Lightning Network in a meaningful way. I will, however, never keep that much BTC on a mobile wallet. My TREZOR will have to be brought out to refill it from time to time. And here is where I think it makes sense to use lightning on TREZOR.

First: I don't personally foresee I'll miss not having the ability to create a lot of channels from TREZOR. I will need a few reliable ones. These, I will use mostly to send transactions - so I am perfectly happy for now not to receive. I would also perfectly happy with only using trezors own lightning nodes, and I think that might make sense for a couple of reasons.

First: I already sort of trust trezor. Since my trezor will not always on, it will probably not really watch the channel. However, since I can envision *only* using it to send LN transactions to fill up my active channels on my mobile wallet. As the benefit of broadcasting an old transaction state is negative (they'll effectively only be able to give me back coins), we can then ignore the always-on-to-watch aspect.

With running dedicated LN nodes at Trezor, it will be possible to customize/fine tune the behavior so that it suits the things Trezor needs, keeps channels open for a long time without any action from the Trezor side, etc.

What do you think?
Spend-only channels?
...to Trezor-run lightning nodes? This will simplify the UI and conf needed in wallet, I think.
...and only possible to use it while connected - and key presses will be necessary to sign transactions."

I am slowly starting to understand Ethereum and the Blockchain, but there's a thing that I am still not getting through.

What I've understood so far is, that you have to pay the miners with gas to get your transaction on the next block. My question is of practical relevance:

Assume I have 1 ETH on my wallet and want to sell it on for example anycoin.com

When I submit the sell-order on anycoin, they want me to send the entered amount of ETH within 15min or so.
During this time, I would access for example myetherwallet. There I have to set the gas limit, which specifies the speed to get on the next block, i.e. to fulfill the transaction. As I've seen, the standard is 21000.

My practical question is now, anycoin expects to receive 1 ETH from me, but due to the needed gas, there will be a fraction of the transaction value deducted from the 1 ETH that I want to send. How can I know, how much exactly will be transferred to anycoin? I am not really understanding, how to calculate the gas price in ETH. If I understood it right, lets say if 21000 gas limit is worth 0.01 ETH, I would have to put 0.99 ETH in my anycoin-sell-order, but would have to send 1 ETH via myetherwallet, the 0.01 ETH would be withhold automatically. Where can I check how much will be deducted?

Do you know guys what time exactly they roll it daily?"
1666,1515077331.0,"In keeping with what seems to be a monthly tradition from me, here are last months earnings from my host.  Recorded daily.  

For those of you new to Sia, I invite you to take a look back at [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/7gx7mz/how_much_do_i_earn_as_a_host_the_november_stats/) from last month as well.

December was a trying time for my poor two little hosts.  We saw block times rapidly increase, and then steadily decline.  This will cause some trouble with contract timings because contracts are not actually formed in terms of ""days"" or ""weeks"", but instead in length of ""blocks"".  

The increase in the price of the coin forced me to make some adjustments to my host prices.  The first adjustment they have seen in 6 months or more.  I am not sure how my better scoring host went from #41 to #65 over night.  Pricing may or may not have been part of that.

Additionally, due to the difficulties caused in Sia's hard fork we experienced, I was not immune to these problems.  Often times I would log in to find my host ""not available"".  And even noted in my spreadsheet when it did not get corrected in SiaHub's next update.

A note I would like to add is that the wallet balances are estimates for this month.  One of my hosts ran dangerously close to 0.  I could not reliably pull SC from an exchange wallet that has nice data logging, so I was forced to move coins between my hosts.  This made it a bit difficult to go through at the end of the month to find which differences were for contracts, and which were to feed my other host.  \#SCExchangeIssues

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/1bMLv) is a little graphic of how much data my hosts are storing for the month of December.  Graphs are taken from [SiaHub](https://siahub.info/) and I always encourage you to stop by his website.  Blue indicates the storage I made available to the network, the red line is my storage utilized, and the green is my estimated daily SC earnings.

Some caveats in the data represented:

* 1 - the ""Locked collateral"" is either not represented correctly or is functioning differently than how I would expect.  As such, it's viability is diminished.   My bug has been filed since July and has not seen activity from the dev team.  Maybe it just functions differently than what I'd expect and I don't get it?  I am dropping this off my radar for January as it is currently just reporting useless information.
* 2 - the upgrade to version 1.3.1 has not corrected the contract count bug
* 3 - the small decrease in ""available storage"" on my host 2 at the end of December is reported correctly.  I had to test a bug where I was unable to properly remove a storage location.  It has been resolved and can say it moved data off one drive at a decent speed and nicely re-allocated across the reminder.
* 4 - Wallet balance is obviously not an actual balance, but just the daily delta.  Estimated for this month due to exchange issues sadly.

[Google Sheets Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9tsEEuJzXiG7ou9xEB-sAkHDkAW-XAzZfGA_M6UgHE/edit?usp=sharing)

As always; any questions, feel free to ask away.  I'll answer them in the morning as it's a bit late tonight during a snow storm.

Tl;Dr: Overall, between 2, hosts I earn an average of 13SC per day.  

At todays rates, that would be about *$13.00* for the month, but it is not fair to base earnings on contracts completing now against their starting price.  As would be true for contracts formed now against my lower storage offerings as we do not know what the future will hold.  It would be more fair to judge them against the price when started, so would be about **$2.00** if we assume the final price on 30-Sept to be 0.004977 if we assume the default contract length of 12 weeks, which we know is incorrect due to block times.

I know there are services like Shapeshift, but I'm worried there is a fee overhead that'll kill these small daily conversions.

We seriously need a company producing open-source and cross-checked FPGAs instead of microprocessors, so that any hardware flaws can be remedied by software. It doesn't matter if it runs on 66 MHz, software can be much, much more efficient than it is today. Would you trust a multi-generational spaceship hosting thousands of people to be run by a grid of Intel servers? What about stock market computers?

Just for illustration, does anyone remember QNX Floppy which had entire graphical operating system with a few apps and ability to connect and browse internet, everything on a 1.44Mb floppy disk? Also check out KolibriOS. I think tiny OSes and microkernels running on configurable hardware are the future of computing, security-wise. No one can really trust a processor with trillions of transistors that's so complicated that it needs an additional processor to manage it's security features. Did I mention that Intel's engineers were smart enough to let their Intel ME run on Minix, which makes Minix the most widespread desktop and server operating system ever? ;)"

I look at what they bring to the table, code quality, ability to change & adapt, etc. Thus I rarely call some major coin/token a sh*tcoin, because even if their initial concept might be called useless by some it can potentially adapted for something else. 

But there is this one coin, that created $1B marketcap overnight and positioned itself as a major ~~cryptocurrency~~ cryptoasset without 0 merit in late 2014 that bugs the hell out of me. The same coin has grown to $140B marketcap and for some reason people continue buying it. You know which coin I'm talking about...

I'ts market cap is absurdly inflated due to constricted supply and has been since day 1. The company behind that company was suddenly a top dog in the eyes of regulators, because of said marketcap, and were invited to speak on behalf of other cryptocurrencies even though they were actually minor players with artificially inflated market cap with almost 0 connection to bitcoin. I guess fake it till you make it right?

Majority of tokens are held by the same company and its CEO. The same tokens are kind of useless as nobody is actually using them outside of some test runs and their system is highly centralized, thus its basically a glorified database. Ironically the CEO of said company is now among the worlds richest people now IF he'd be able to cash out at current price. If that doesn't show you how absolutely overvalued XRP is I don't know what will.

Why I'm talking about this on r/BitcoinMarkets? Because if a sh*tcoin like XRP can reach such a valuation, then one can assume that coins with some actual uses (like smart contracts or anonymity) could easily repeat the same achievement and one shouldn't be surprised that Bitcoin (even combined with Bitcoin Cash) dominance continues to drop. If we exclude non-minable coins/tokens - things are looking better, but IMO  the day of some coin reaching parity (with BTC in terms of marketcap) looks a lot more plausible...

FYI I trade XRP fairly often and have made a lot of BTC with it, though consider holding it a sign of stupidity."

1947,1515091815.0,"In the current climate I think the best advice would be, don't be complacent. We have no idea what the next few months or the year holds. Many of us, me included suspect the alt coin market will crash and burn soon but it very well may not do. For all we know we might see even more of it as we sit here in disbelief. 

Many of the new uneducated buyers quite frankly don't give a fuck about the tech of the coins, they only care about how much money they are going to make. You can't reasonably argue with them, if they get enormous returns on something...well... people won't say no. It's gambling, simple as that and people love a good gamble. Especially when the 'win' could change their lives.

Will alt coin money flow back into Bitcoin should it crash? I suspect not so much. If the noob market gets severely burned they'll most likely return to fiat and lick their wounds. 

Are we assured of a huge run again on Bitcoin? Again no. We all desperately want it but we might not see it quite in the numbers that we all want. 

The positive is that, as we have recently seen, many many coins have had ridiculous gains. Bitcoin is more than capable of firing up and doing the exact same thing in the near future. We could very well be sitting here in 3 months moaning about the correction from 60k down to 40k. Who knows?

Likewise we could be sitting here bemoaning the bank favourite Ripple sitting at the top of the tree whilst Bitcoin struggles to climb back to 20k. 

I choose to be positive and believe that Bitcoin will soon regain it's mojo and fire back. I won't be complacent though. No amount of TA adequately predicted the recent explosion that we've seen. For the moment, we're all spectators hoping that our favourite coin succeeds.

Plenty to be optimistic about though. Bitcoin has weathered many a storm and always come out the other side stronger than ever. If history repeats itself, we're all in for a tremendous year.

1988,1515093674.0,"Few thoughts:


-People were right, we are in a bubble... Alts are clearly in a bubble, but BTC is Amazon. 


-BTC is easily going to be a trillion $ asset class... top 35 alts don’t all deserve their billion $ valuations. 


-BTC dominance is 35%, I believe it can regain up to 50% when alt coin season is over (not that dominance matters... but in context of market cap it’s going up). 


-BTC had the most conservative rally last year by far. Don’t think that BTC can’t experience a mega-moon scenario when the time is right, and demand catches up to supply. 


-If you haven’t noticed, BTC is getting attacked everywhere. For every positive tweet you’ll see shills comparing this to myspace. Most of them are gonna be eating their dicks sooner or later, but this reminds me of 2015 when noobs were lured away from the prize. This is why everyone won’t get rich, even though Bitcoin is a godsend for us regular folks. Keep you eye on the prize. 


-Still think BTC will take it easy this month, and alt rally will continue for a few weeks / months. Imo you should use the opportunity. Don’t chase pumps that already happened... but look at the 1d BTC charts of STRAT, GAME, LBC and tell me with a straight face these aren’t going up in this alt season.

The whole point about something that can potentially skyrocket and allow for unexpected millionaires is that it is not obvious or there are no guaranteed signs. It just happens, and if when you see the sign you are not already onboard then it is already too late.

It is super annoying to see everyone complaining that TENX or isnt seeing the gains that other alts are or that TENX should be following others explosion . This isnt the case, TENX will have its day and it will be just as big as some other coins when it does, it is just going to take time...

Do you think the people investing in Bitcoin in 2011/2012 when it was mere dollars had any idea they would be worth $15000 each today?

No, it is usually a risk and based on hope or expectations for the future, but nothing is a guarantee, if that was the case then institutional investors would swallow up everything they could and would net the guaranteed rewards.

2071,1515097692.0,"I see some people posting about the Bitcoin Cash price concerns and I remember posting something about Bitcoin Cash price vs value back in August. It was true back in August and it is true today. I stand by my words.

Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that ‘Price is what you pay; value is what you get.’ Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down. - I like bitcoin when it's so cheap. We may never get to see bitcoin at the sub $1k level again after this year I think.

“Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well.” - With all the people dumping their Bitcoin Cash, lol, I'm glad to be one of the beneficiaries early on. I believe in the long term prospects of Bitcoin Cash because I'm an investor, not a speculator.

“In the 54 years (Charlie Munger and I) have worked together, we have never forgone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views of other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.” - It's ok to have the trolls from /r/bitcoin spreading misinformation because I always do my own fact checking and research.

“You need to divorce your mind from the crowd. The herd mentality causes all these IQ’s to become paralyzed. I don’t think investors are now acting more intelligently, despite the intelligence. Smart doesn’t always equal rational. To be a successful investor you must divorce yourself from the fears and greed of the people around you, although it is almost impossible.” - Damn right.

“I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them because sooner or later, one will.” - Bitcoin Cash was the simple decentralized peer to peer digital currency by Satoshi Nakamoto. Legacy bitcoin was made so complicated with segwit and lightning network and all the other bells/whistles, that it is no longer secured.

So yes, I really like Bitcoin Cash. I am a tech geek who happens to know about economics and I can see Bitcoin Cash replacing the legacy bitcoin. In the short term, markets may be completely irrational, but I'm a long term investor, not a speculator.

It goes without saying Litecoin breathes the spirit of BTC in that it wants to cut out the middleman – the greedy central and commercial banks - thus putting the “whole value” back in the pocket of the everyday man and woman.

I personally think LTC has become too valuable and will never achieve this. 90 billion Litecoins are not enough.

It pains me to say it but the banker friendly central XRP coin have got the supply right.

HERE GOES:
It would be wise for Litecoin to consider a FORK where a circulating supply of 90 billion new LTC forked coins are issued and mined. 
It would mean each hodler would receive 1111approx of these new LTC forked coins.

Please note I am not convinced with the decimal point argument. People will want full coins. 

Just for the record, I believe, of all cryptocurrencies on offer LTC is most ethical, stable, prosperous and liberal coin out there. I hope to one day to use it for what its intended purpose.

2123,1515099365.0,"Anyone who cashes out before 2020 is an idiot. Holding crypto-currencies (especially the top projects e.g. Bitcoin and Monero) is going to ensure wealth over the next decade. We are witnessing the biggest money revolution the world has ever seen. 

Fiat is inflationary - it's designed to go down in value and buying power. Crypto-Currencies on the other hand are inherently deflationary by design, because they are scarce. This moment in time will go down as one of the easiest periods in history for the lower and middle-class to move up the socio-economic ladder. The entire world as we know it will change and move away from the banking cartel/dictatorships as we know it today. They will be forced to accept this new era of economics. They know this. They cannot afford to get left behind and those who chose to do so will inevitably suffer with a late acceptance and pay the price or ""miss the boat"" as they say.

Most of the newcomers over the past couple of months are clueless. There is no barrier to entry. The pros for this are obvious but head over to r/cryptocurrencies and you can see the problem. This is not a con of the no barrier to entry - it just highlights people's tendencies to being impatient, greedy and stupid. They are gambling and giving power to ponzi schemes. These newcomers will be finished once the market returns to giving value to only solid projects and this is going to happen. 99% of the projects today have no real world use-case. 

We are witnessing wealth redistribution. We will look back and be like 'how the fuck did we go along with this shit for so long'. Banks are slow and inefficient. Hidden charges. They destroy countries and ruin economies. They are just an awful service. Whereas crypto is constant development. Code - the language of mathematics is one of the sole drivers and it's a language most geniuses speak.

2131,1515099713.0,"Just opening a discussion about the reason I feel the price isn't as inflated as other coins in the cryptosphere.

Monero is actually used in business by Darknet operators/sellers.

When people buy the products from a DNM operator (with monero), those funds have to be cashed out to re-buy stock for sale, so when people buy *insertillegalproduct* from the DNM and they are paid in Monero, that Monero needs to be cashed out as soon as possible!... 

DNM sellers are not as concerned with making profits from the actual trading of the coins but by turnover of their stock on the DNM, therefore they will happily take under-market offers to get the necessary fiat that they need to quickly re-stock.

I highly doubt that in any other coin except a handful, are being trader with under-market offers, because they are all speculated assets, thus inflating the price of the coins dramatically... Monero however is limited in its scope of being an inflated worth due to its real-world usage, and the necessity for the DNM operators to quickly transfer it to fiat to re-stock supply.

Thoughts?

TL;DR - Monero has more under-market trades than other coins due to being used on the Darknet and not primarily speculation"

While I am glad about the recent price surge, as I'm sure many others are too, NEM regularly lags behind Ripple. As far as I can tell this seems almost soley due to NEM's lack of exposure to Korean markets while Ripple is listed on nearly every major Korean exchange. 

Ripples best exchange by far is Bithumb KRW with $3 Billion of volume. The next closest? Bitfenix in USD at $9 Million.  

In addition Ripple has direct exposure to several other fiat currencies that NEM does not including Rubles, Thai Baht, Indonesian IDR, Brazilian BRL, South African Rand ZAR, & Ukranian UAH.

Price wise we are not moving up or  down that much (we are missing the current alt run). I tried to swing trade 3000 lisk and it took me 2 hours to do that (still netted 40 lisk) 

That should not alarm you though. IMO nothing much will happen before 20 Feb. Maybe a teaser from LISKHQ, however we will have a bull run before that the price may rise x2  because a lot of people that sold to get in other coins will come back. New people that follow crypto calendars will also start to prepare for the news.

The real deal will be 20 Feb and what happens after it! If Lisk becomes the talk of cryptoworld because of a great presentation, release, relaunch and so price may rise in contrast of what we normally hear... buy the rumors sell the news.

If lisk goes the path of mass adoption (Javascript, easy to make side chain mean ton of ICO's)  seeing 1000$ by the end of 2018 is not far fetched. Could we see again the ICO's madness that ETH caused on steroids?! I know 1000$ sounds crazy by the end of the year, but ETH currently is 930$.
IMO LISK should be better than ETH, considering they will have a 160 people team in 2018, updates should be plentiful.
Side chains made by LISK team are not out of the question also. Crypto pet games that can easily run on Lisk, maybe Crypto Pokemon for real. Considering 95% of internet pages use Javascript the sky is the limit.
We should see ton of great ICO's in couple of months. So hold on tight and HODL! The time for trading will come later and the time for x5 Ico's made on Lisk is couple of months away!

For the Desktop Wallet even reinstalling didn't fix it but deleting C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\ArkClient folder did. No need to reinstall. This will also remove the accounts you have on the wallet, so you need to import them back.
I guess by deleting just one file from \ArkClient would solve it, but I already fixed it by deleting the whole folder, so I don't have a chance to test which one.

2235,1515103274.0,"So we held right around $240 through yesterday but at midnight the sell pressure started to increase again.  Now we're getting some conflicting signals--The Stochastic has us oversold and the conversion line/base line isn't indicating any more downward pressure for the moment--but the ichi cloud is pretty bearish and the RSI still has a ways left to fall before it's indicating oversold as well.

Based on this, I think a trip down to ~$220 is probable but I don't expect a steeper drop than that nor do I expect our foray into the ~$220s to be long-lived, though any climb back upwards will probably meet some significant resistance around the $240 mark.

2236,1515103308.0,"Coming up on $1k USD ETH.   On gdax I see 30k available for sale <1k but the last 1h candle shows 15k ETH purchased to take us up to 975USD.

I'm pretty convinced Bitcoin is undervalued relative to the peers in the space simply by the drop in cap as the sub $1 coins pumped.

Given the move in XRP, ETH is undervalued relative to XRP.  I think by at least a factor of 2.  This means either XRP comes down or ETH goes up (imo).

Looking like money has moved horizontally in the space looking for the next 'big'(10x) winners and moving them.   Since XRP could now buy the entire ETH space (if you believed the exchange could happen at current rates) expect some to take profits and move back to BTC and ETH as well as try some other alts.

I don't like to pump anything.  But if people are looking for some value that could also get a pump and rise (Just over a double so far) is Iconomi (ICN).   If ETH continues to rise Iconomi has like 300K of it if I remember right (as well as BTC and other holdings).   Outstanding ICN is like 100M - do the math on what the value is of it based on the holdings alone at the current ETH/BTC etc. prices.

Literally selling still for < 1:1 of book value of assets held.

I'm convinced it still has room to triple to $10 here.

I am also thinking ETH will make steady and slower progress price wise.   2k USD ETH this year is not unrealistic given the sheer amount of money entering the space.

Keep an eye on BCH and LTC as the upper tiers of coins should get some movement if BTC can get some legs while the Sub $1 coins that moved 10x begin retraces.  ETH hitting new ATH may also drag in some FOMO money.

How many here same date last year thought ETH would hit $1k in 12 months?   

I surely didn't expect this much, this fast."

Trump is a billionaire. Like most billionaires, people talk to him (and to his family, some of which are young enough to believe in such tech as cryptos). It's next to impossible he's not aware of it, even by proxy.

When you have money to spare (gamble) for a chance at insanely high returns, you don't think twice before dipping in those waters. Risk: negligible. Potential gain: astronomical.

I'm pretty sure he already made insane bucks with cryptos. Probably not directly, but through some friendly ninja-asset-manager who used a couple millions to ROI in the 8-9 figures. 

He could already be a silent whale in the cryptospace for all we know, he's sure got accurate reports on how cryptos could become a powerful force in the future, and he's got more than enough means to hedge for that possibility.

2336,1515105871.0,"The entire crypto market has grown by almost 200 billion since new years. Lots of hype that started with bitcoin going nuts, then XRP taking off. Lots of people are trying to get money in and are still being held up by verification processes, transfer times etc... I've had 3-4 friends approach me about crypto because I told them about it months ago and now that they are seeing it in the mainstream news they want in...

So what do these people do? They start at the top and buy whatever they can that is cheapest. Ada's cheap, Tron is cheap, XLM is cheap. I'm not saying that they are all bad coins; I'm just saying I think they are all currently overpriced and have huge market caps. But it's easier for people to ""buy more whole coins"". Yeah you could have bought into ada at 2 cents and made 50x returns. But it won't sustain that growth. if you look at their roadmap lots of basic stuff like a wallet is only 20% completion. They still have a lot of ground to cover. Then look at LSK which has a working wallet, Lisky and now Lisk Core. Not to mention there are less coins to go around.

Just give it time. I don't expect the market cap to stop growing. More and more people will come in especially when we top a trillion and it makes even bigger news. Just invest in what you believe in. If you have some extra cheddar to spare look for top 100 coins in the sub 20 cent range with billions of market cap and maybe toss $100 in. When you get 5-10x return, pull it out and put that money into what you believe in (LSK) that serves a purpose."

I am just starting on learning Solidity and Ethereum and very confused about the whole thing.

Current situation is:

- I have deployed a simple voting smart contract into the testnet using Truffle framework
- I am able to vote using the contract owner account

What I want to do next?
- I have another machine also connect to Ropsten, I have another account with different address here
- I want to use this account to interact with the above contract, I understand I have to define the contract with its above address, but I don’t know how to do this in Truffle. Read the documentation but not really get it.

Also can you guide me what’s the simplest way to interact with a contract without having to write the whole html/css stuff? I just want to write some contract and using some kind of console to play around with it.

I talked with a good friend of mine about crypto exchanges and real investments like gold, silver, real estate, stocks.. I asked him, what he will do when his crypto will reach for example a value of 1-2 million dollars. He told me that he will take the money out of the crypto market and put in other stuff like gold, real estate and so on. Then i asked him. ""But what if there will be 
a bigger inflation in the next 1-2 years and a normal apartment will cost 1-2 million compared to 200.000-300.000 at the moment"". He told me that this will not happen (I was laughing). But then he asked me: ""What would you do"". I told him. That this is why i am holding OmiseGo. If that will happen and OmiseGo is a game changer i will be able to earn money by holding OMG. People don´t understand that when crypto is rising more and more, fiat is also losing its value = The risk of a hyper inflation is rising. So, do not forget that OmiseGo is not only a token that is currently traded for 20$ per token. OmiseGo is also an investment. Stop thinking about getting a dollar millionaire, because the risk that a million dollar is worthless in a few years is really high. "

This concludes the first part of the event. The second portion of the event will be a panel discussion with:
Moderator: Bitmain Founder @JihanWu
Panelists:
$NEO Founder, CEO of @onchain_dna @dahongfei 
$ELA Founders Han Feng and Chen Rong
6:37 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


The theme of this discussion: The future of the blockchain industry in 2018 $NEO $ELA #G3
Moderator: Bitmain Founder @JihanWu…
6:38 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: Fungibility is similar to Turing completeness, possible in theory but doesn't exist in reality. Even in ZCash, the fungibility of the tokens that are transferred cannot be said to be the same. These models should work in real business world $NEO $ELA #G3
6:42 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Han Feng: Blockchain brings a world where the power is transferred to the consumer. Fungibility, through the concealment of all transaction details, should be a fundamental right for the individual consumer. $NEO $ELA #G3
6:43 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: In $NEO, people in the international community are worried of Digital Identity. In fact, this is an opt-in requirement, based upon your transaction requirements. Some transactions such as trading of house rights etc, in order to remain regulatory compliant $ELA #G3
6:45 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Next topic for the panel: Scalability. Ethereum was taken down through the Crypto Kitties game, Bitcoin discussion led to the fork of $BTC and $BCH $NEO $ELA #G3
6:47 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Chen Rong: You cannot ascertain a blockchain network throughput based upon the throughput of individual nodes/computers. It is based upon the network constraints and constant development of the blockchain network. $NEO $ELA #G3
6:49 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Chen Rong: If Crypto Kitties is deployed on the Elastos blockchain, it should not be a problem in terms of scalability. These games will be ran on individual phones, and updates will be sent via the blockchain network, unlike Ethereum which runs on a global computer $NEO $ELA #G3
6:53 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Han Feng: The flaw of $ETH is that all these computing power is ran directly on-chain, which results in a network congestion. $ELA provides a local environment for execution of these dApps $NEO #G3
6:55 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: This topic can be split into two: 1) Technology 2) Consensus in deployment for this technology. $BTC had many options for number 1, but failed in reaching consensus for the deployment of these technologies. He believes that $ETH PoW might face a fork $NEO $ELA #G3
6:56 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: In a network's infancy, $NEO decided to use a governance mechanism that relies heavily on centralization (for early stages only), that allows it to quickly upgrade its protocol and come to a consensus $NEO $ELA #G3
6:58 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: The issue with $ETH VM is that smart contracts that can be mutually called, and possibly called within the same block. This forces transactions to be processed in order, rather than in parallel, which is possibly within $NEO VM. 
$ELA #G3
7:00 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Han Feng: What is the value of $BTC? These digital data is creating wealth for the future, similar to how America is still the world's wealthiest country even though most of the mass-production isn't done within USA. The lynchpin of this system is the trust in the US System
7:14 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


With the advent of blockchain, we will see a paradigm in the future smart economy. From an economy backed by government and institutional trust, to a future that is backed by cryptography and digital data. $NEO $ELA #G3
7:15 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Chen Rong: A cyber world is the new frontier for the human race. Within the cyber world with P2P trade of physical and digital goods, this will revolutionise the world!! $NEO $ELA #G3
7:18 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Right now, the speakers are answering Q&A questions, and it is hard to translate their thoughts into a specific theme. I will update if any interesting thoughts are brought up $NEO $ELA #G3
7:44 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Chen Rong: 
Gen 1 Blockchain: $BTC - Security 
Gen 2 Blockchain: $ETH - Programmable smart contract platform 
Gen 3 Blockchain: $ELA - dApps running on local hardware interacting with the blockchain
7:47 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: An interoperable standard is required to connect multiple blockchains, that will eventually be able to support the entire world's data and trading volume. One such example would be @OntologyNetwork $NEO $ELA #G3
7:55 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Jihan: @BITMAINtech will be investing huge amounts of money to improve Bitcoin Cash development in 2018. Bitmain is also an early angel investor in both @NEO_Blockchain and @elastosofficial. Some of the profits from $ELA will be used to set up a fund to promote $ELA
7:59 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Da: G3 is made up of projects that are distinctive, well-known worldwide. He is looking for talented developers, especially from China because most of the international developers are international @coz_official $NEO $ELA #G3
8:01 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Chen Rong: In the future, we hope to expand G3 beyond the initial three members, to G4, G5, G6, adding on top-tier projects to this entity. $NEO $ELA #G3
8:03 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


Han Feng: 
Bitmain has the strongest computational power in the world.
$NEO is the most advanced smart contract platform. 
$ELA is the operating system for the smart economy.
8:04 PM - 3 Jan 2018 


#G3 will be the foundation for something truly special. 

And that's a wrap! Thank you for tuning into my live translation for the event. 

A big thanks to @elastosofficial and @NEOnewstoday for supporting my trip to Beijing!

2450,1515108735.0,"It works flawless, thanks so much!"
2451,1515108736.0,"This paper sums up as a typical Bitcoin maximalist position: Bitcoin doesn't need high transaction rates because it's a store of value, and Ether is a fuel not a currency. 

> the circulating portion of the tokens can circulate at the speed of computer processing and bandwidth—i.e., fast and accelerating. The implication is that average velocities can and are likely to be high

It makes no sense that monetary velocity would be high just because it's all running on computers. The fiat world mostly runs on computers too.

> the cost of using decentralised protocols is deflationary, since the cost of processing power, storage and bandwidth are deflationary

Yes but transaction costs are a small portion of Ethereum's GDP.

> Use cases will be limited [due to cost]

Just a failure of imagination here, I'd say. Also a lack of understanding of scaling solutions.

> The ability to fork protocols maximises utility for users but suppresses economic rent for token holders

Because Bitcoin's forks really depressed the BTC price, right? He continues this argument later, saying that proof of work is somehow a defense against forking, and proof of stake tokens will go to minimal value because they're trivially forked. I think in practice we'll find that's not the case at all, because network effects really do matter. 

>  an aggressive group of forking developers could reallocate the foundation’s tokens to their own new entity in their fork

It's hilarious that he thinks that fork would attract users.

> Ethereum could serve as the backbone for processing smart contract operations for (hopefully) untold numbers of decentralised applications, DAOs, etc., and perhaps one day maybe even something like the fabled Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 

Fabled? Does he understand anything about how Ethereum works?

On page 10, he estimates the value of ETH based on gas fees alone. He ignores that ETH is used as money for lots of other things, like ICO contributions, gambling, ENS registrations, straight-up payments, etc. (His calculation does show why it was smart to ignore all the people claiming ETH was just a fuel, not a currency.)

He also argues that because PoS will reduce security costs, it will reduce ETH value. I don't think this makes sense because mining expense is a consequence of coin price, not the other way around.

From footnote 20:

> At that point it will matter not whether you use Ether, Bitcoin or any other token — all will work equally well.

Except that Bitcoin can do 3 tx/sec and has no smart contracts.

He starts to reveal his bias here, comparing Ethereum with Bitcoin:

> a more complex protocol with a larger attack surface, shorter track record, less decentralised governance and propensity to make backwards incompatible protocol changes, for a hugely robust, stable, proven, and widely accepted protocol that already performs that narrow function very well

The weakness of Bitcoin will be more apparent when Ethereum's transaction capacity increases by 100X this year. He tries to head this off by claiming that a monetary store of value doesn't also have to be a working payment system. 

> Bank deposits are a monetary store of value but are neither a payment rail nor cash... Credit cards clearly aren’t a store of value. 

But they both use the same underlying currency. 

> On the other hand, gold is just a monetary store of value but not a payment rail. 

But people used gold for payment for millennia, the dollar was backed by gold until 1971, and even today, certain countries under sanction are using gold for international payments.

The rest of the paper builds on these same flawed arguments. "

2457,1515108886.0,"This doesn't make sense. Monero's DNM usage is infinitesimal. Slowly growing due to BTC's uselessness, but still small share. People are moving from BTC to LTC and BCH, and in last place XMR.

Miners always existed, and some other coins have miners too.

The reason XMR is going down while the majority of other coins are going up is because people are running away from bitcoin since it's useless due to its fees. They see that monero is the 2nd most expensive and they just run away from it. A few people tried to show how we needed to fix the fee issue on last fork but developers ignored. Weren't for bulletproofs showing up (made by other people) monero would be well below 0.015 now, since developers were reluctant to admit a problem existed and wanted to relay on Lightning Network (coming in 18 monthsTM) to fix it instead of changing the fee structure.

Anyway, we will have cheaper fees in march (finally!). Until then, expect shitcoins to keep surpassing monero in market cap. Due to multisignature and bulletproofs in march, that situation should rapidly reverse."
2458,1515108905.0,"ARDOR and IGNIS are closely tied. Since ARDOR is the forging token, an increased usage of IGNIS will lead to bigger gains for forgers on ARDOR and therefore increase the value of the token. So more success for IGNIS will always result in more success for ARDOR.

But this does not apply the other way around. Ideally there are a lot of childchains in the future and any of them can lead to an increased value of ARDOR. So more success for ARDOR does not necessarily mean more success for IGNIS.

Also for the value of IGNIS to increase, adoption or real world use cases are mandatory. For ARDOR to be profitable to hold there just have to be transactions on the child chains (for example caused by pure speculation/trading).

This does not mean IGNIS wont be successful, but I think the more time passes and the more child chains are created, the higher the probability that the value of ARDOR will outperform the value of IGNIS.

This is my opinion on the topic, but the conclusion assumes logical assessment and behavior of the people, which is not the case for the cryptomarkets :D  "

2465,1515109038.0,"Hello All,

I am a relatively new investor for Enigma, although I have been trading crypto for the past year and trading Options . Once I found out about this coin a few weeks ago, I loved the project and the team and invested 100k into the project @$3, which I now have a nice %100 return. Enigma is still surprisingly cheap, sitting on only around a $500 million Market cap. I believe crossing the $1B threshold is certainly achievable in the next month. As we have seen with other coins such as Verge, which saw a $2B pump in a week, I fully expect word of mouth about this coin reaching the ears of a Market Mover like John McAfee. Considering that a small fraction of US citizens even know about Bitcoin, it won't be too long before these same novice investors  stumble upon ALT-coins. Now the most appealing coins to a novice investor will most certainly be coins such as Stellar, Verge, and TRON all of which are under $1 per coin. As soon as they become more knowledgable as an investor, you'll more investors looking for specific coins.


For me, as an investor in crypto, I look for atleast 3 out 4 main ingredients when it comes to investing in a project; 1.Low Market cap relative to other coins, 2. low Coin Availability (20-200 million) 3. What does the product do/trying to do and 4. Is there major competition for this product. What you see with Enigma is 4 out 4. Low Market Cap when compared to the top 30 coins which are all $1B or above. Low Coin availability which can lead to larger gains with smaller pumps in market cap atlas in regards to supply/demand. Enigma, as far as I know is the only team trying to develop Private Smart contracts, so they have no competition. 


My prediction for Enigma based on the fundamentals at play and with of course technical analysis is as followed; $1B market cap by end of month, mid February at the latest. I can see Consolidation at $1B as most coins that have similar Coin availability see this as a heavy resistance/support level. I can see $1.5-$3B by July-Aug. By late Fall, early December I wouldn't be surprised if Enigma sat at $2.5-$4B. Now I have seen other projections, some as wild as $250 per coin which would equate to around $18-$19B in Market cap. Can Enigma achieve this cap by end of year? If they can release a product and it is SUCCESSFUL by then, hell yes. But I rather set my expectations at realistic levels considering the difficulty of producing this product, but once successful omg forget the Moon, we're going to Mars.  I think Enigma is an extremely solid project, long term hold and would recommend it to anyone in the crypto space. 

Let me know your thoughts, there are many variables that come into play of course and this is just my most modest prediction. For all we know, Donny J can sign a bill or send a Tweet  that can mess all this up lol but I try to be optimistic."

However, Zcash seems to be very cheap against BTC if you compare it against other projects. Before going in I´d like to hear from you guys if it is a good idea. Is there any reason why Zcash hasn't been affected by this run already?

Would be nice to get some feedback on this theory:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7o0eyr/comment/ds6ic7i?st=JC0NMFD2&sh=21f35714

Its a wall-of-texty, but the TL;DR is a question: Who owns the most shitcoins? Well, isn’t it the people who got in on the ground floor? That’s the big ICO participants for the ETH tokens, big banks for XRP. So its mostly going to be old school Crypto OGs, millionaires, family offices and maybe some institutional money. These are the people selling these coins to the FOMO victims... and what are they getting in return? BTC/ETH/LTC/XMR/USDT... and once the order books are ripe for the picking, they will market sell the remainder of their stack to clear out the order books in one click and make damn sure no one can run for the exit, because the fucking door frame is on fire.

My theory on what is going on"
2479,1515109318.0,Monero's more stable value probably means it's closer to being used as actual currency than many other coins.  Plus it's fungibility and privacy can only help.
2480,1515109319.0,"The reality is Lisk needs a product, they are putting more effort into that because they probably now realize that, that's the good news. If core 1.0.0 means devs can start developing, then that's great if not when will the complete package be available.

Maybe a teaser of what core 1.0.0 can do, alot of confusion as to what it actually is, clarifying it's role in relation to the SDK may help. I'd love Lisk to be $1000 by the end of 2018 I don't see it though, not by a long shot. If everything is released as per the new time frames, it'll be over $100 by end of 2018 how much over no one knows and $1000 is completely unrealistic as much as I would love that to be the case.

Right now everything Lisk is ""potential"" there is no end product. I hope that the management are maturing and seeing that although they have their own vision of Lisk, it's important to market for a crypto audience.

As for ICOs made on Lisk in a couple of months, you're kidding right, that kind of nonsense does Lisk no favors. The SDK is expected on the 1st of April (now imagine not delivering on April fools day!) it's simply not possible for an ICO be to made on Lisk before that. All going well maybe last quarter of 2018 but a couple of months, that's fantasy talk."

The disadvantage of transmitting the username and password as query parameters rather than post data, is that the clear text password will be stored in the browser history and most probably in server logs too. However, the solution is not to hash the password before transmission, but rather to follow the standard practice of submitting the password via a post request over SSL."

Additionally I signed up for coinseed which rounds up debit transactions to the nearest dollar and once it reaches $5 it invests that into the cryptocurrencies I choose.  In my case I picked the big 4 as they are calling them.  
Finally I intend to take half of the money my Acorns account which just rounds up and puts them into stocks and roll them into my coinbase account.  It has built up to $1100 over the last few years. 
 At this point it will be $550 going into my coinbase account.  
This seems like a low risk possible high gain investment.  I still have an IRA and 401K through my work.  I plan to hold and ride it out for years to see where this goes and since I won't notice the money gone I can just be patient."

The connection is negotiated first, and then and only then, are the query string and header values sent.

On both sides, holding a volatile asset is a risk. Some people will flip in and out quickly to minimize their risks on both sides. Some people will be willing to take longer risks on both sides.

As others have said, transactional volume is still low enough that speculative ""investing"" is driving the price, not transactional inefficiencies."

2830,1515115066.0,"So I'm pretty concerned about the current state of crypto.. Cardano, EOS, IOTA, Verge, XBY are all super highly valued with little product behind them. The overall crypto market cap is increasing by like 100B a week. The dot com bubble popped at 3 trillion so if crypto pops at a similar time, it could be happening even as soon as Q2 2018. 

I'm really hoping that everything cools down and we can see a steady growth rate over 2018. But if everything keeps going up 20% a week, I don't see how this is sustainable for the year.

I'm not trying to FUD or get anyone to sell, just looking for some other people's opinion on the state of the market.

EDIT: Here's some basic math to show how these returns are not sustainable. at a 5%, 10% and 20% weekly return for the next 52 weeks. With the total crypto market cap calculated in 52 weeks time given a total market return of 5%,10% or 20%.

For every $1,000 invested, your return would be...

5%: $1,000 * (1.05^52) = $12,642 = 1,164% RoI = 9.8 Trillion Total Market Cap

10%:  $1,000 * (1.10^52) = $142,042 = 14,104% RoI = 1,071 Trillion Total Market Cap

20%: $1,000 * (1.20^52) = $13,104,630 = 13,310,363% RoI = 99,587 Trillion Total Market Cap

&nbsp;

I want to begin by saying thank you for the feedback that I have received over my last two threads in diving deeper into the Markets and Adoption that OmiseGO will be facing, now and into the future.   
&nbsp;

A major goal of mine is to inform others on ""What is OmiseGO?"" and the path it will have to pave moving forward. I want to make a Q/A Analysis Series, where I will attempt to create a detailed analysis on community topics and questions. In order to do that, I am looking for topics that people might be interested in learning. Therefore, if there is anything you are interested in gaining more knowledge about, please let me know with a comment. A more well informed community will provide a much more successful attraction to users and potentially businesses.   
&nbsp;

Here are some topics that I am thinking of working on:  
1. Underlying Technology of OmiseGO and How They Work. (Plasma, etc.)

*This is an imprecise and selective measurement, but it is a rough and interesting proxy for the volume of new users coming into crypto*

https://coinrank.neocities.org/

Key Takeaways: 

* **Most since Christmas:** The record volume of new users peaked with the ATH last month, but the drop has levelled off over the last few days, and today the latest alt runs pushed mania to the highest fever since Christmas. Bithumb is back to #4 in South Korea and Coinbase is back in the top #100 in the US and Australia.
* **Binance:** Binance continues to improve its market share, bursting into the Top 400 in Germany, the Top 300 in South Africa, the Top 200 in the US and UK, the Top 150 in South Korea, the Top 60 in Australia, and the Top 30 in the Netherlands, among many others.
* **India cooling off:** The world's second most populous country continues to cool off, where bitcoin app Zebpay has fallen from #11 to #20 in the Finance category, and off the Top 500 altogether. Binance has been crawling up the #40's in Finance the last few days but is not exactly picking up the slack there yet.

2943,1515116944.0,"Can anyone please confirm this is right? Of course nobody knows what will happen but I am trying to get a grip on things.


Casper is coming soonish and it allows larger ETH holders to put their ETH in a special wallet to get ETH dividends. However, you need a bunch of ETH to be one of the first to do it. This is a great thing because it makes things faster cheaper and more lucrative. Also ETH will probably be added to the future exchange like Bitcoin soonish. These things are probably not priced in and will cause ETH's price to rise. This should happen within a few months. However, there is likely to be a smallish price correction sometime as we have had quite a good run recently.

That said, there has been a huge rise in the price of coins that do not not have clear and demonstrable value due to FOMO. Also Ripple (centralized banking crypto) has risen crazy amounts. This can also be seen in LTC, BTC and alt coins. A large amount of potentially uneducated investments could lead to a signifiant market correction. This would be due to people panicking and realizing the crypto they bought doesn't do anything. However, crypto with long term genuine value will survive and potentially do very well."

I imagine a new kind of global company, totally based on blockchain/smart contracts (or something that evolved from it), that employes anyone that can contribute and offers solutions anyone can use.

2964,1515117229.0,"Honestly - the taxation part is fairly negligible in this scenario.

If you live in an ideal world where you can buy DCR directly - let's say you buy $1000 worth. Moving forward, your cost basis for your DCR will be $1000.

Let's say that instead of buying directly to DCR, you instead by $1000 of ETH. Again - your cost basis is $1000.

When you go to an exchange to do your ETH -> DCR transaction, the profits you take during that taxable event will be with respect to your $1000 cost basis.

If ETH goes through a crazy spike before you buy DCR and your $1000 of ETH turns into $1500, you would only still owe taxes on the $500 profit. Instead of buying $1500 of DCR, you could just buy $1375 and sell back the remaining ETH to pay for taxes. The vast majority of the time - price spikes will be much less than 50% for a few hour to few-day turnaround.

If your ETH maintains value and you buy $1000 worth of DCR for $1000 of ETH - it's a taxable event, but the gains from your cost-basis of initial purchase is 0... so you would owe a percentage of $0... which is 0.

Heck - if the value of ETH goes down or the fees are more than the inputs, you can claim a short term loss against the rest of your capital gains. If you're in the 28% tax bracket and lose $4 to fees moving from USD->ETH->DCR, the IRS would actually owe you a little over a dollar!"

I want proof, and not random allegations about this comment.

You have personally made a very large accusation against some of our more used software. Including one which comes direct from Core Devs.

Am most curious about your comment regarding the android wallet. Given you are here informing users, without any actual information with it nor have you ever contacted anyone about any issues you have personally had. Making the leap to it being a scam or not functional is disturbing.

The code is public, there is nothing malicious in it. Nor has there ever been any losses from the software itself in all the years. There is a whole lot of user error, and people who do not backup as they are supposed to. These issues are not code issues, nor does it make it a scam nor nonfunctional.

Given the amount of users who have used the android release for several years with no issues, and no losses..I am taken aback and figured, you would have some insight on this that I am apparently missing.

I freely concede that freewallet is an issue, has had issues, and is very public about it. However it is a very different thing to lump not only the android release which is from core, but the ios wallet which has been maintained for years with little to no issues and no known losses together with it.

It is bothersome, and disturbing that you have made these accusations and it has remained here on the subreddit of which you were gilded for. The rules are still intact which makes it odd your post remains."

""""Undoubtedly, virtual currency and virtual currency derivatives present both significant opportunities and challenges. As a Federal market regulator, the CFTC is cognizant of the considerable risks of virtual currencies like Bitcoin. In addition to the nascent stage of the technology itself, risks associated with virtual currencies include: operational risks of unregulated and unsupervised trading platforms; cybersecurity risks of hackable trading platforms and virtual currency wallets; speculative risks of extremely volatile price moves; and fraud and manipulation risks through traditional market abuses of pump and dump schemes, insider trading, false disclosure, Ponzi schemes and other forms of investor fraud and market manipulation."""

3003,1515118074.0,"In my opinion, cryptocurrency in general has been so bullish that it has created its own financial dimension. We will continue to see the whole market continue its insane growth for another while but will see dismal returns from BTC. After Bitcoin's incredible rise in 2017, a vast majority of us has expected some sort of correction or re-entry into a short bear market (6-12 months). BTC has been resilient to such correction in fiat value but we might have to look at it from the point of view of the cryptocurrency world. 

Maybe we actually are entering a bear market for Bitcoin. And during this period, we will continue to see Bitcoin's dominance continue to fade. Alts will continue their growth in valuation in sats, fears of ""flippenings"" will continue and be echoed across all mediums, and many uninformed investors will be led to believe XRP, ETH, and co. will become the new standard of cryptocurrency. And right when the faith of Bitcoin has been tested to the point where even the most loyal  hodlers are contemplating trading for alts, the honey badger will leave its den restore its title as King.

edit... 
[From the crowdsale doc (page 20):](https://cdn.omise.co/omg/crowdsaledoc.pdf)

>OMG will be a standard Ethereum ERC20 token, until the OmiseGO chain (“OMGchain”) is launches. When OMGchain is launched, ERC20-OMG is used as a Proof-of-Stake token on this network. This is achieved by allocating control of one’s the ERC20 to an ETH contract reflecting the OMG chain. Further improvements are possible from reallocation of ERC20 tokens and may be taken if it proves to be a better design, but the current approach is to have the ERC20 token locked into activity on a contract on the ETH chain. It is the responsibility of the community to elect to allocate the ERC20 token towards the OMG chain, as the community has control over the network."

3077,1515119210.0,"[This post explains it well](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@tomshwom/ethereum-gas-how-it-works).

Gas is a unitless measurement that quantifies the amount of computational work a transaction takes.

You set a gas **limit** to define the maximum amount of gas (computational work that you will pay for) for a transaction.

You also set a gas **price** which defines the amount of Ether per unit of gas you will pay.

Your total fee is the amount of gas *actually consumed* multiplied by the gas price.

21k gas is the *absolute minimum* for a normal Ether transaction, contracts can consume many times more than this.

Gas fees are usually taken from the address, not the transaction amount. This is how it works on the Ethereum backend, but some applications that let you do things like ""send all"" will deduct gas fees from the transaction amount so that it can actually go through.

If you're sending a transaction for 21k gas, the fee completely depends on your gas price. Check ethgasstation.info for information about current competitive gas prices (since it's an open market that determines this).

@jevgeni please ask in #general we are in AmA now

**tranzer**
Hi Persona team. Is Persona gonna run on new Ark engine v2 or you gonna run on current v1? And do you have any plans to collaborate with Ark team on development front?

**notrius_** 
What are your plans to penetrate the South East Asian Markets?

**ioanafrincu**
@slacktastic Persona represents the solution for identity management, aligned with the latest data protection regulations. Its scope is to empower the customer and grant him/her the control over their personal data as well as the means to secure access to their private details.

@tranzer we aim to have it run in v2

Hello @ioanafrincu welcome to our great community. What makes your project different from something like Civic? What is your ICO price and total supply? 

Thank you for joining us here. :lel:

@slacktastic Persona represents the solution for identity management, aligned with the latest data protection regulations. Its scope is to empower the customer and grant him/her the control over their personal data as well as the means to secure access to their private details.
Posted in #trading_altcoinsToday at 6:07 PM

**dancearnau**
@votequimby: From our point of view Civic is just a glorified Facebook login. It doesn't give you a real identity. The scope of Persona is to actually prove your identity (legal) in the real world. This goes from a visit to the bank to opening a new utility contract & etc.



**ioanafrincu**
@notrius_ we will start with European companies but having the EU focused on high standards in data protection we plan to go global with our verification services through a system of ambassadors in major cities.

**votequimby**
I want to invest in this just for that shot at Vinny :dongle:

**dancearnau**
@votequimby: We will issue 70m tokens during the ICO at the price of $0.2 / token.

**Glory** 
How big is this issue of verification and what are some applications and examples?

**votequimby**
Thank you :slightly_smiling_face: Good luck and success to you guys.

**mward**
@dancearnau is there any pre-sale bonus? (edited)

**tranzer**
What happens if not all tokens get sold? Are you gonna keep or burn? Is there any minimum to start the project?

**mward**
and where is your office located? Romania, Bucharest?

**Glory**
There's no max amt of tokens right?

**ioanafrincu**
@mward the pre-sale bonus is 50%


**Nord1n**
When are they for sale?


**ioanafrincu**
@mward yes our development office is in Bucharest


**dancearnau**
@Bootlegjim: The user data is stored on the blockchain, so the user becomes the true owner of his data. You own your data, and you just *give access* to 3rd parties to access your data.  We are not looking into a digital-only service like LastPass, since we want to see Persona used in the real-world.



**mward**
and it's open for visiting? don't know... maybe in the future :joy:

**mward**
i can understand better in romanian

**mward**

**dr10**
What is the hardcap of the crowdsale?

**Bootlegjim**
@voosh we are currently having an AmA could you please move to #general for right now :slightly_smiling_face:

**dancearnau**
@Glory: The issue is pretty clear. If you want to use 4 cryptocurrency exchanges, you need to do KYC individually for all of them. With Persona, you can use the same KYC/AML and share it between services. You can find applications and examples in the whitepaper (financial, utilities, parcel services, etc)


**Glory**
I'm curious as to the use of the persona token?

**dancearnau**
@dr10: We will issue 70m tokens at the price of $0.2 / token, this results in a hard-cap of $14m.

**Bootlegjim**
What was the reasoning for picking Ark as the foundational blockchain?


**dr10**
Can you elaborate on your inflation model, why did you chose 8 Persona Tokens / Block in the first two years?


**Glory**
Does this mean that the token would be used for transferring or tx fees of your persona data?

**ioanafrincu** 
@Nord1n in about one hour the pre-sale access emails are sent. The public sale starts on the 1st of feb

**dr10**
And can you explain how you plan to verify individuals? I've heard its face to face within a meeting? Is that the only way you go?

**ioanafrincu**
@tranzer the unsold tokens will not be issued

**Glory**
Is there a minimum amount necessary to join presale?

**Glory** 
I didnt sign up for it am I still eligible?

**ioanafrincu**
@Glory there is no minimum for the presage

** dancearnau** 
@Bootlegjim: Because Persona is also aimed towards corporations that want to share customer data between them (at the will of the customer), we need a *DPOS* blockchain.

**tranzer** 
Is voting staying same as with ark and 51 delegates or you thinking of less / more delegates?

**Bootlegjim** 
Forgive my ignorance, as I did not come prepared for this, but when you are building your own blockchain on Ark, whatdoes that entail? DO you still use the Ark Delegates and such? Do you use the mainnet?

**Bootlegjim** 
what @tranzer said :slightly_smiling_face:

**dancearnau**
@Glory: The token will be used to get your identity verified. In order to increase your verification level (like a Tier), you need to get verified by more individuals/companies. Each transaction will carry a tx fee in Persona Token (PRS)

**dancearnau**
@tranzer: We will have 51 delegates, same as Ark. We want to keep a fast block validation.


**tranzer**
Are there any companies that already shown interest in this kind of service?


**ioanafrincu**
@dr10 we did the computation based on ark’s model. Basically we believe that having this amount of tokens released will not “flood” the market with tokens neither encourage pump and dumps.

**dancearnau**
@tranzer: We already did a Proof-of-Concept for Societe Generale (a big banking in France) and we have had about 5 requests for integrating Persona with build-in systems of existing companies.


**Bootlegjim**
When it comes to that verification, you say on your website that ""Persona notaries near you"" will bring your verification you 90%. Does that mean you have to have notaries world wide? How do you plan on achieving that?

**dr10** 
Can Persona be used as 2FA for smart phones and IoT devices?

**ioanafrincu**
@Bootlegjim the delegates will be different. We are developing the project with the ark technology but it will not rely on the ark blockchain to function


**dr10** 
Can it be used to verify your true identity, when you enter a chatroom? Like ""This is the real CEO of that upcoming ICO""?

**dr10** 
And can you explain how you plan to verify individuals? I've heard its face to face within a meeting? Is that the only way you go?

**dancearnau**
@dr10: Persona can be used to prove your identity on a multiple range of devices. For example, you can secure your IoT device by enrolling it into Persona, and configuring it to only accept commands from your digital identity.

**ioanafrincu**
@Bootlegjim we plan to start with ambassadors in major cities and organize meetups for a start. So those people who want to have a community verification will be able to meet and get verified by notaries
 


**tranzer**
So we can expect this to be for EU mainly at start?

**votequimby**
thats pretty cool

**skewed**
The ambassadorship is awesome.

**ioanafrincu**
@tranzer we aim to start the partner with companies who verify European citizen data, but just as I explained above, we plan to go global

**dancearnau**
@dr10: You can get verified by both individuals in face to face meetings, as well as by companies. Different services require different type of verification. For example, banks may only accept verification (KYC) done by another bank.

**votequimby**
This is already waaayyy more together than Civic :thumbsup:


**dr10**
So verifications might require me to be physically there (wherever the verification is needed), or can it be done by webcam?

**ioanafrincu**
At the beginning it will be face to face. Probably after about six months of having it live we will take webcam into consideration. It is pretty easy to claim fake identities through webcams. @dr10


**LarryChristo3**
Man, just think about how easy it would be to go through a credit check with Persona!

**M N**
I'm invested in Civic and already want to move my investment over to Persona lol

**votequimby** 
What are your thoughts and philosophy about the current state of Exchanges? Are you going to attempt to get on them? Are you prepared to pay their listing fees? (edited)

**tranzer**
What happens if someone steals your identity (private key). How will you be able to purge old one (blockchain and all) ? Smart contract?

**ioanafrincu**
@votequimby we are planning to go to exchanges. Paying a fee is normal as it is a service that they are performing, but let’s hope the fees are not moon-high


**dancearnau** 
@tranzer: If you lose your private key, you can generate a new key (identity wallet) and start retrieving your identity by getting verified. It's the same method as someone would report a fake account. Users can get verified, but they can also lose verifications if notaries reject them.

**Bootlegjim** 
How exactly are PRS used? Can you guys give an example, I have read the white paper now but i still do not understand the process flow for use.

**ioanafrincu** 
@Bootlegjim the PRS tokens will be used for paying the verification fees. Based on the complexity of verifications we will have different fees, adjusted periodically


**M N** 
In regards to Civic, it sounds like they are already targeting legal identity through a variety of user submitted documentation and org. verifications.  I'm not so sure it's just a Facebook type login.  Can you elaborate on that? @dancearnau



**Bootlegjim** 
ea. When someone wants to lets say validate my information, they would be required to pay a fee with PRS, and similarly, if I wanted to make a bank account or something - I would need to pay the verifcation fee which would be with PRS. Am i getting that right? Or something of similar nature

**dancearnau** 
@M N: There are 3 main approaches: 1) User-verified identity, in the form of a trust system. You get verified and get trusted by the community, so more individuals/companies want to do business with you. 2) Persona will be used to share identity (KYC) between companies. So instead of providing your identity to 4 banks, you can just share the identity verified by one of the bank with the other 3. This means we will create a *Single View of User* between companies, services, etc. These 2 implications have nothing to do with a legal identity. The 3rd approach is to have a legal framework in which users can use Persona as a national identity system.
 

**votequimby** 
This project is really competent so far guys. Congratulations and kudos to your team.



**ioanafrincu** 
@Bootlegjim only the verification requester will pay prs tokens.


**Bootlegjim** 
Great, so then my next question is really in regards to using DPOS. Since there are only 51 delegates actively forging, there is clearly an incentive to be a delegate for large banks using Persona. COuld you comment on Persona's stance in regards to big banks possibly just buying their way into the delegate spot and possibly corrupting the blockchain?


**Bootlegjim** 
What I mean by this is if big banks have many delegates, they can either accept changes to the blockchain or not. They essentially control the future of it. Which i guess they do now for financial insitutions but you get my point :slightly_smiling_face:

**acedizzle** 
When is the token going to be live?


**ioanafrincu**
@Bootlegjim corporate partners cannot be delegates
 


**Bootlegjim** 
Okay!

**Bootlegjim** 
Well that clears that up :wink:

**Bootlegjim** 
But, one cannot be so naive to think delegates will not be influenced by corporations acting in their best interest

**M N** 
the fact that it's progressing so well on the Ark platform is amazing... how is your experience so far building on and working with it? @ioanafrincu @dancearnau
  

**dancearnau**
@M N: We've been following Ark development since it's inception (as Stefan is a co-founder of Ark). Ark blockchain provides a unique landscape for developing trustless applications by applying the DPOS consensus.  We've been working on integrating Ark with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) in order to bring smart-contracts on the Ark blockchain for some time. As we mentioned, we will do a fork of Ark, so we will have our own implementation of the protocol with our own public blockchain.


**nomtombot**
Sounds very similar to Civic, but Civic is launching on RSK in Q1, has a working product, already announced several large partnerships, and in closed beta with many others.

How does Persona plan on differentiating itself, especially considering Ark as a network has not been proven to be as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain?


**ioanafrincu**
@acedizzle we plan to have the main net live in March/April


**dr10**
OK, we are approaching the 60 minutes mark. Any last questions for persona team? Anything the team would like to add or tell - feel free to do.

**Bootlegjim**
Thank you for joining :slightly_smiling_face:

**pieface**
Sounds really good

**ioanafrincu**
@nomtombot we plan to have the data cryptographically secured, therefore Persona there will be a zero knowledge data sharing dapp


**itsdmac**
When you click Join the presale, it asks for Amount, is that amount of Persona you want?

**nomtombot**
Thank you @ioanafrincu   Definitely will be keeping track of the teams progress!


**MYTHZ**
I've been reading, and just want to say thanks for your time and work, I love the project! :smile:

**Auph**
When is the sale?

**Nord1n**
Thank you for joining.

**mad4thrash**
Do you see Selfkey as a competitor?

**Nord1n**
@Auph Register with your e-mail on there website for pre-sale.


**Auph**
So there's no date for the pre-sale? 15 Dec seems to be an outdated date

**ioanafrincu**
@itsdmac it means the equivalent in $ that you wish to invest


**Auph**
Or pre-sale is private?

**ioanafrincu** 
@mad4thrash we have different strategies so there is room for everyone

**ioanafrincu** 
@Auph we have allowed subscriptions from December 15th onwards. Now we are sending the emails

**ioanafrincu** 
Guys, thanks so much for joining and being interested in what Persona’s plans are! We hope to see some of you as delegates, ambassadors or notaries in the future :smile_cat:

**M N**
thank you for the time!


**pieface**
What role will ambassadors/notaries have? Will it be a ""paid"" role or a volunteering job? (edited)

* Transparency: https://district0x.io/transparency/ transparency page. Detailed information about wages, wallets and the roadmap. I like the weekly communication in the blog. I think in general most people in crypto will think positively in regards to the transparency of the District0x project. The goals of the project may be hard to understand especially if your coming from a ""coin investor// what is the value of this coin"" perspective. I would rate this as a 9. I asked for some information regarding the usage statistics of the current active districts. Hope they will still provide this. 
* Visibility: This one is hard. In regards to the life cycle of this project and cyrpto in general I do think we are really in the beginning. This is just the start. In the start, I don't think visibility to the masses is a must. I'm very happy to see that the team is currently actively looking for partnerships as I think this will be very important for DNT in the future. These projects will make District0x more visibile in the future. As we for instance see with Bounty0x. Idk, currently I would rate this at a 7
* Innovativeness - the idea of DAO's on the blockchain is not new. Combining the idea of DAO's with a easy way to create marketplaces I do find interesting and somewhat innovative. I think it is interesting imagine what would change if Amazon was a DAO with governance on the blockchain. I give it a 7 maybe 8. I'm especially interested in the governance aspect of both DNT and Aragon and do think both projects aim to bring something to the crypto community which is innovative. 
* Usability: Just try the 2 current projects as well as the current Bounty0x platform. The end product, the market place is very user friendly. Not yet clear for me how we will interact in terms of the governance aspect. However, this is something the team will still have to develop. Currently, with the available products I would rate this a 8
* Market Cap: 2 products available DNT usecase not 100% clear for everyone. I think the current market cap is ""Ok"". 7
* Potential Network: These guys aim to create a network of marketplaces. The partnerships today look very good. 9

Verge (XVG) uses features from Tor and I2p (countering each others weaknesses) in the system, allowing for greater security than if they were implemented individually. Verge also uses multi algorithms. With these features and the New Years release of wraith protocol, allowing the user to choose whether new addresses made in the wallet use Public or Private IP addresses as a choice.

I’m worried that the same “loophole” they thought they had regarding distributing their cards worldwide ( wavecrest loophole) is going to happen to this strategy of theirs of “don’t EXPECT the rewards but you’ll get em” 

Part of it is due to the communication:

1. When investors first started to worry about delisting (bittrex had just delisted bitpay(I think it was this one) because it’s a security, the TENX team reassured us that the PAY token was not at risk at all
 
2. Then it was, the PAY token is not a security and we’re just waiting for our lawyers to have it in writing for us. They TOLD us it wasn’t a security but we’re waiting for the piece of paper.  - roughly how they said it 

3. We need to restructure the token, and don’t EXPECT a reward but you’ll basically get it 

And now I hear that PAY will be used to purchase the card thus offering some utility 

Now I’m heavily invested in MCO as well. And Monaco has had their fair share of issues with the rewards system. And this is coming from a team with a huge finance background and whose main core competency is “compliance”. They officially removed their rewards system / asset contract and they plan on bringing it back (after an outcry from investors). 

The way I see it, this issue was something no one can see coming. I use Monaco as a baseline because their whole team motto is “ compliance compliance compliance”. If they’re having issues then it was inevitable for TenX to see them. Time will tell if they sort it out "

L3 + = 800w / 110v = 7.27 amps

L3+  = 800w / 220v = 3.63 amps per 110v side

D3   = 1200w / 110v = 10.90 amps

D3   = 1200w / 220v = 5.45 amps per 110v side

S9   = 14th unit = 1372w / 110v = 12.47 amps

T9   = 1576w / 220v = 7.16 amps per 110v side


OP is very VERY correct. 

I have a house with above average amperage box initially. 

I was able to add 2, 240v / 30 amp breakers to my box and that maxes my house out from power coming in.


Electrician warned me I may have problems when the dryer runs if those 2 breakers are maxed out. 

I had to call an electrician, have them run 2 240v lines to 2 NEMA L6-30P plugs. (3 prongs, snap on and twist type plug.)

Got a great price on the install and came in about a grand for the whole install job. (breakers and wiring)

Then I had to pick up 2 PDU's 240v /30 amp power splitters to plug the units into. (look up the price on those suckers) Range anywhere between 150-500 each.

And that will support up to 6-8 units and my house is maxed out.

If I want more I need the power company to come out and put in a new line. 

And then I remembered I'd best get a surge protector just incase but check out a 240v surge protector price. Thats insane.

So yes, please consider your power max output of your house or unit before you go buy 10 s9's!

3283,1515122515.0,"I have been a long time lurker on this sub, and love this community and the Ark project.  The team is awesome and following the roadmap has been such a fun ride.  

The purpose of this post is not to spread FUD, however I recently have become aware of an issue that is very concerning to me, and I feel this issue needs to be discussed openly for two reasons:

*To inform my fellow Arkies about what is currently going on with the network

*To foster a healthy discussion focused on a solution to the problem

**The problem:**
Per my discussion with biz_classic here on reddit, it appears there is an ""investment group"" (whale) that owns at least 3, maybe 4 delegate nodes.  Their nodes are running on really bad hardware and always go down which slows the network down.  Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about them since we can't force them to unvote themselves.  It appears as if these delegates do not seem to care that their nodes go down daily for hours at a time.

Per my discussions with another delegate (dutchdelegate) on slack, the main network issue right now is caused by some relay nodes and 1 delegate not having enough RAM.  However, the delegate cannot be contacted.  He starts producing bad blocks, causing other nodes to become confused.  This delegate has no contact info, and is a multi millionaire so he cannot be voted out of the top 51.  Dutchdelegate seemed to believe that Ark V2 should fix the problem because the delegate won't process much transactions in V2, and he won't send bad blocks either.

The temporary and current fix, as I understand it, is for delegates run a program called ""Noah"" that automatically downloads a snapshot of the blockchain and restores the blockchain when the network halts and the delegate nodes randomly fork.  

**My concern:**
DPOS is what really drew me towards Ark.  I love the idea of having a voice (my vote) and I really enjoy the passive income from staking.  HOWEVER, DPOS relies on this idea that delegates will want to perform well because it is in their own best interests for the Ark project to be successful.  I never thought about what might happen to Ark if a few whales decide they don't want to upgrade their potato nodes and cause Ark to come to a screeching halt.  In my opinion, these bad delegates must be removed ASAP from the top 51.  

tl;dr: Ark DPOS is experiencing some growing pains right now.  Lets open up a discussion.

3287,1515122585.0,"I have a good friend who I'm afraid is going down this path. He's been married for several years and he's gotten in the doghouse with his wife several times before for not being up front about financial stuff. Last year they almost got divorced because he had a secret bank account that he was using for sports gambling.

Anyway, I kinda regret it now but when I first got into crypto I talked to him about it and piqued his interest. My plan was to put a little in that I could afford to lose and mostly hold and see what happens.

Literally within days after he started he was already talking about his daytrading and ""moving my ETH stack for a big BTC pump about to happen, then I'm going to move into XRP and maybe back into ETH on the dip"" etc. He won't say how much money he's put in but I know it's a good amount, and he's been cagey when asked if he's discussed this with his wife.

I'm worried for his sake that his daytrading ways are going to lose him his money. Even worse than that I'm worried that he hasn't been up front with his wife and this could cost him his marriage for real this time.

TL;DR: If you have a spouse don't try to hide this shit from them. Tell them about your investments and make them understand the upside."

Simple example, somebody throws a $1000 into Ripple at 3 and it goes to 1, he can escape into BTC before it goes to 50 cents, but he's likely going to be skittish and pounce on cashing out if BTC makes even a modest gain (or shows even a hint of weakness)-- right? "

Cryptocurrency's are quickly becoming the hottest market to invest in.  The market is clearly very volatile but the returns can be remarkable and can happen in a very short amount of time.  If you are new to the space and semi-nervous about what to look at, I would suggest first looking at the more 'blue-chip' cryptocurrencies as they have at least been around for a while and most are somewhat 'battle-tested'.  These holdings being: $BTC (Bitcoin), $ETH (Ethereum), $LTC (Litecoin).  There are many other options, but these are probably 3 of the most stable of the entire sector.  Start by researching those, and branch off from there.  It would be wise to at least have some % of your portfolio in 1 (or all 3) of the above, then take a smaller % and 'gamble' a bit by choosing a smaller marketcap coin(s) of your liking.

Do you think NASA took calls from every curious teenager to answer questions about radiation shielding or propellant systems? Heck no! 

For the most part, people realized that it would take a small miracle get everything off the ground. And they knew that the engineers were doing the best that they could. People were excited to go to the moon but they were not impatient because they knew it was going to be a monumental challenge. And even if the engineers involved wanted to give minute by minute updates to the local fan club, they were too busy to do so.

If you want LTC to go to the Moon then let our engineers work in peace. Trust that they will let us know whenever they reach a big milestone. And believe that they want this win more than you do, so they're going to be working their very hardest until they achieve it. 

On that note, you should understand that their moon is probably different than yours. They're not looking for a few dollar signs or a lambo, they're looking to disrupt the financial sector with a revolutionary piece of technology. 

So if you want to post memes, then leave the low hanging fruit for the spam coins. Don't post memes about price or launch pads or your boredom. 

Instead post memes about the bad ass engineers who are making this all possible. Post memes about the people who are busting their butts to make digital money a reality. Honor the people who have decided to wage war on the financial sector with a keyboard and a blockchain.

**This could be a new revolution and change the financial world as we know it.**

I've connected some puzzle pieces from different channels, and I am fairly confident something HUGE is about to happen. This is just a theory, but could happen faster than anyone of us can imagine. 

* **One year ago** - [Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/what-facebooks-european-payment-license-could-mean-for-banks/) acquired **licenses for e-money** and payment services out of Ireland.

* **8 december** - One coin on Coinbase triples out of nowhere. LTC.

* **11 december** - Video of Chamath Palihapitiya (ex-FB executive) made world news by him saying that Facebook is 'Ripping Apart' our society. Couple days later he [adjusts](https://www.facebook.com/chamath) his statement. He was away from Facebook for 6 years, and a little bird must've told him something drastic. He is also a big crypto enthousiast.
> ""I genuinely believe that Facebook is a force for good in the world. The team there has taken real steps to course correct. They’ve begun important efforts to protect elections, promote more civic discourse and remove or reduce the spread of fake news, polarization and sensationalist content. I know they are investing to do even more in the future.""

* **12 december** - Facebook Messenger boss David Marcus (ex-PayPal president) joins the Coinbase board.
> ""I'm convinced that what the company is working on has the potential to materially change the lives of people around the world, and I'm looking forward to working with Coinbase and its leadership team to help make this vision a reality.""

* **20 december** Charlie Lee sells/donates all his holdings in the cryptocurrency to avoid conflict of interest.
> ""Will still be rewarded in lots of different ways, just not directly via ownership of coins.""

* **21 december** Frank from LTC Foundation commented on the ""BIG"" surprise.
> ""We'll need to wait for them to integrate support before it's officially announced in 2018.""

* **4 januari** - Mark Zuckerberg announces idea of implementing a **decentralized cryptocurrency** in FB [post](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571).
> ""The world feels anxious and divided. Back in the 1990s and 2000s, most people believed technology would be a decentralizing force. But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.
There are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.""

* **4 januari** - BTC and LTC atomic swaps are rumoured to be in finishing stage.
> Retweeted by SatoshiLite: ""Nearly instant atomic swaps via Lightning Network are coming sooner than everyone thinks. Definitely not a year away, but mere months.""

This is a long shot, but I suppose Mark Zuckerberg is struck by philanthropy. He has the key to make this world a better place. The only thing he needs to do is integrate a decentralised coin into Facebook Messenger, and thus the pocket of almost every human in the world. He has the power to connecting the world socially and economically. It will make him the most influential person of this century."

3415,1515124233.0,"Great question Shawn and one that must be puzzling a lot of people, myself included. 

My personal (that’s the disclaimer) opinion is that “currency” is a misnomer for all cryptos. They are all acting and trading as commodities. In that sense, you can say that it was probably not what Satoshi wanted to create.

And the reason why I feel this way is because the only way you make “money” from cryptos today is by exchanging them for fiat currency - which continues to be the “real” money e.g. you can’t buy a pizza with crypto and most definitely, you can’t make any bigger purchases like a car or house without converting your cryptos to fiat currency.

With a true currency, if you paid a certain amount to buy a certain thing, you can safely expect to pay similar amount over a decent period of time. With crypto, that certainly is not the case. So it’s more like a commodity whose value changes based on supply/demand, wider environment and market sentiment (albeit on a lot more volatile basis than regular commodities).

So maybe, crypto-commodity is more befitting than cryptocurrency."

3534,1515125953.0,"A few traders and I noticed a pattern and we are hoping that some additional clever minds in this community can help us all get one step ahead.

The pattern.

As we saw over the past few hours, all stocks are green and on a bull. Then simultaneously across the board everything goes down. 

Now the reasoning

1st Red Bar:  The first red is because the value of BTC increased. Therefore alts that are paired with BTC immediately show red as it now costs more sat to buy that same alt only seconds ago - before btc price increased.

2nd Red Bar: The second red bar I suspect are bot that have been setup to identify the BTC rise, and auto sell as they know the third Red bar is coming.

3rd Red Bar: The every day people looking to make a dollar watch the first red bar and say “oh no” we hit a red bar, they brace hoping it’s just a momentary thing, but as they brace the bots intelligently sell creating the 2nd Red bar. Human psychology takes over and a round  of humans sell. This confirms to the other now rattled humans that their stock is headed down and sell creating a down trend and a further pump of BTC.


Just take a look at any random 5 stocks over the last few hours on a 15 min window you will see they all dipped simultaneously because of the rise of BTC. 


Whilst I’m open to people’s thoughts on the above observation, I’m very much interested in a bot that alerts me of an incoming  BTC break out which in turn causes this  nasty flow on effect. 

Happy to fling someone crypto dollars as a thank you for the right bot to use.

Up until Jan 3rd, Bittrex has blocked xvg trading through Upbit (so basically, XVG was listed in Upbit before, but Koreans weren't able to buy it). I could guess slight pump was from this? (considering time zone, when XVG pump started, that was like Jan 4th afternoon in Korea) I still believe it won't pump the price up a lot since Koreans still need to buy it thru USDT, thus they would have to first buy anycoins with KRW and sell for USDT (too much hassle and fees) But given the fact that Upbit is Korean version of Bittrex (meaning they have a lot of different coins in market) Once they allow XVG-KRW or even XVG-BTC/ETH, it would certainly help pumping XVG. the other coins listed today on Upbit are: ADA-USDT, BTG-USDT, NXT-USDT.

3) At some point the alt traders are going to take profit, and where to? To BTC or ETH. But BTC did not have a big 2 week trend, ETH had. BTC in favor here. Also this is the first alt rally for a lot of new traders, they do not know that 90% of the alts that was on top on CMC 2 years ago no are basically worth 0. They have also not experienced a real cycle shift to BTC

By looking at some others that have low market supply and or high, but more importantly the price, there is somewhat of a pattern of investments being made into the cheaper prices simply because everyone here and those who have never even heard of cryptocurrencies would want to make earnings while the number of capital gain increases for those who went ahead, before, and are sometimes day-trading. Although I do agree among the statement of the stock market example, there is likely to be less involvement in such activities since there is less, as I said before, ""less capital gain"", involved in the current situation as well as the interest that is increasing in the media. There has never been a time where so many people are gaining tremendous profits and losing from others as a result of strategies and they consequentially suffer from both mental stress and greediness.

3785,1515130092.0,"I gave up trying to find a reason and stepped out. Am really a big BCH proponent but it's price action is just too weird. Either endless slow bleeding and downwards pressure or some sudden spike followed by immediate decline.
I'm sure it will prove its worth and maybe even come out on top, but after months of waiting I've had it and went with the waves. Will be back when things turn around.

I'm no conspiracy theorist at all, but do think BCH's price is somewhat manipulated. Also Coinbase not releasing the BTC and EUR pairs is weird (although their listing was great of course).

There's just so much politics involved. And airdrops from forks don't help either. Gives opponents a lot of powder to shoot with (sell off). But manipulation also works the other way round, with those Antminer's only being available for BCH. So there are pro's and cons but somehow it all just doesn't feel really natural. Like a couple of bigshots are still fighting it out with huge numbers involved or something.

I hope and think it will blow over. The coin is still in its infancy of course. And the fact that without one thought I automatically go for BCH when transferring assets intra-exchange is a good sign. I guess there's more people like me who inherently see the added value that BCH brings. Good for adoption and integration.

LONG LONGGGG before gold existed. On Easter Island where there were only like 50 people and everyone used limestones as currency and things were worth what everyone would SAY they are worth.

I mean if the entire worlds investors start investing in crypto how much capacity do we have? I'd say at least 500M investors worldwide would be investing in this asset whereas currently we probably only have 20M total individuals. 

IF you run some basic numbers based off that (avg investment per person etc) I think the total market cap of 700B isn't really that high.

For example if you were to sum up some of the main exchanges across the world whats the market cap of them? using that number(albeit perhaps at a 1/5 or some other fraction) could potentially be the ceiling for what we can see down the road?

3974,1515132783.0,"So I'm looking at purchasing some AMD Rx series cards.  I want to find out which manufacturer would be best to go with, I've heard MSI Rx's have issues when it comes to mining. I'm hoping that somebody with more knowledge can let me know the different intricacies for each card. First I'm just going to list the cards and the prices I could get them at:

AMD Gigabyte Radeon RX 580 4GB - 1.34 GHz Core - 1.36 GHz Boost Clock: **$260**

XFX Radeon RX 580 4GB - 1.26 GHz Core - 1.39 GHz Boost Clock: **$270**

AMD Gigabyte Aorus Radeon RX 580 4GB - 1.37 GHz Core - 1.38 GHz Boost Clock: **$280**


AMD Gigabyte Aorus Ultra Durable Radeon RX 580 8GB - 1.34 GHz Core - 1.36 GHz Boost Clock: **$280**

I guess I also need to know what the pros/cons of the 4GB vs 8GB is. From the research I've done the 8GB provides insignificant hash rate increases, if any. But I've found that the 8GBs may be better for longevity because they'll be to handle mining the current blocksizes for years at this rate. As opposed to the 4GB editions which could be phased out if blocksizes get to big. I've heard 3GB cards will soon be useless for mining for this reason.

So how likely is it that 4GB cards will be phased out in the near future? Other than longevity what are the pros of the 8GB cards?

What card would you recommend I get based on those prices?

I also have access to a wide array of Rx 570s for slightly lower prices. Would I be better off getting the Rx 570s if that's the case?

Sorry for the long post but I'm making sure I dot my 'i's and cross my 't's before making the leap. I'll also be buying in bulk if that makes a difference.

I got the send address from Shapeshift, put in my paper BCH address as the refund address and my XRP address as the target address, and sent the coins directly from my GDAX account.  They’re gone from my GDAX account, and when I got back to my machine the shapeshift transaction had timed out.  I checked the BCH return address and the coins aren’t there, either.  Are they gone

Edit: Update: I can see the coins were sent in Coinbase to the correct address, but there are 0 confirmations.  It has been a few hours.

Edit 2: Thanks for the help.  It actually did confirm, even with the 0 fee that Coinbase had set.  Shapeshift refunded the coins to my BCH paper wallet, all is resolved."

Anyway, one of my coins has grown roughly over 300%, so I wish to sell off some of this investment, as I believe the coin is going to start dropping significantly soon.

I use the buy low, and sell high trading strategy, but the problem being is I haven't sold any alt coins yet.  Due to my long term strategy to obtain more Bitcoin, should I simply use the percentage of the alt coin sell-off to go directly to Bitcoin now.

Allowing nodes to stake tokens and run computations is at the heart of our network. This is the main mechanism to incentivize players and ensure correct execution. So we’re definitely planning that for 2018 in one of the early iterations of the network.

As to how many tokens - Enigma has a fixed amount of 150M tokens. These are the only tokens that will ever exist to maintain the utility and security of our network. In such a system, it only makes sense to have a dynamic amount set as the required stake, in order to maintain the fine balance between security and decentralization.

For example, the number will differ based on how many nodes are present in the network - whether it’s 1K, 10K, 100K or more. Our working plan is to model (based on simulations) the right initial number, and allow the network to vote on changes."

They also don't understand design tradeoffs and can be easily misled. For example, Ripple's transaction speed is not impressive at all considering that it's not a trustless and decentralized system.

It's also hard to sell people privacy because they don't understand the risks until it's gone. They don't understand that it's a necessary for regular people even as a matter of physical security.

I did this on the wallet.trezor.io website after installing the Chrome add-on but not using the actual chrome add-on from the chrome apps page.

I'm not sure how to proceed now as my user guide which accompanied the trezor states that I can put my data at risk using unauthorized software.

4084,1515134735.0,"I’ve wondered the same. My only rationale is that we just saw a major market wide correction after Btc literally went to another galaxy. BCH is still pretty dependent on Btc, let’s not forget that. Alts are pumping that don’t meet criteria for sound investment imo... scarcity, utility, and function... things like cardano, Trx? They easily could be great long term, but right now it’s 100% speculation. They’re not worth billions imo. I also don’t think Btc or BCH are worth their market cap, but at least they meet the criteria. 

My guess? After the alt pumps start to correct and some profit grabbing occurs, the money should funnel back into the more stable platforms of Btc, BCH, Ltc, ETH, etc. the whales too are laying dormant after such a huge correction and consolidation in December. If you bought at ATH you’ve gotta wait it out. Don’t go chasing it buying up alts at ATH and compound your losses.

We’ve been spoiled seeing stupid magical ROI on crypto this past year. Get your head back on Earth. Where else could you go turn $100 into $200, $300, $400 + in a year?

It's the same people that you get on every board of more fundamental heavy coins, they make the generic 'Yeah but token X went up by %%% this week, why didn't this one, it's a lost cause' posts. In a way they are right in not buying into ARK, because it's highly unlikely that it will double by the end of the week, and quadruple into the next.

It seems apparent that dumb people outnumber the smart people, look at the major elections and referendums we've had all over the world recently where people are misinformed in masses and the option that seemed 'trivial' wins out. That's my very sceptical opinion but it looks like that to me. Good news is that the dumb money will run out relatively quick, the rate of money flowing into crypto is unsustainable, and when that tide stems, it should filter out some of the so called hype tokens and the ones with things to show will stand out.

4142,1515135552.0,I subscribe to several different cryptocurrency subreddits.  Many of them mostly consist of people either shilling or spreading FUD on the PRICE of that specific coin/token.  SiaCoin is up almost 30% in the last 24 hours and I can't find a single post or moon/lambo/rollercoaster meme anywhere in this subreddit.  Everyone is focused on the VALUE OF THE PRODUCT that SiaCoin is offering.  That really says a lot in my opinion.  It tells me how serious this community is and I love it.  Let's keep spreading the value of SiaCoin as a product and let the price fall where it may.
4143,1515135573.0,"I don’t know of any claims they’ve made regarding that specific date, but audits aren’t usually the kind of thing that are done in a day. An audit tests the balance sheet *as of* a certain date (and the income statement for a certain time up to that date), but the audit itself occurs sometime after that date and can take days/weeks/months. The 2nd of January would be an odd date to conclude an audit, because the 1st is usually a holiday. (Also, the date *as of* which the financial statements are audited is almost always a month-end date, not the 2nd or any other date within the month.)

That said, to my knowledge Tether has not established a clear timeline for an audit, has not said what period or periods will be audited, and has produced no real evidence that they have engaged an accounting firm to perform an audit. I don’t even know what their fiscal year end is or what jurisdiction they’re in (which could determine the accounting standards they’d follow and the auditing standards their auditors would follow). 

I will be shocked if a legitimate audit ever occurs. I believe Tether does not want an audit under any circumstances, probably because they do not actually have full control of $1.5 billion USD and definitely because an audit of financial statements under either GAAP or IFRS would indirectly reaffirm they are under no legal obligation to ever pay out USD for the $1.5 USDT that are outstanding at the moment. If Tether *did* want an audit, I’d be shocked if they could find a reputable accounting firm that would be willing to perform the audit, both because the topic of cryptocurrency accounting is still a new field that presents enormous and unprecedented challenges to an audit, and because Tether (the business entity, not the token) has a ton of red flags around it that make it clear this would be an extremely high-risk audit client."

[I have been advocating it for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7atptr/coindesk_article_from_2014_breaks_down_why_bits/), since bits cannot be feasible on Bitcoin Legacy it can only be a thing on Bitcoin Cash.

4164,1515135833.0,"Short answer: no.

The Lightning Network that everyone is talking about isn't a change to Bitcoin, it's a ""layer"" that uses Bitcoin.

Some features like Schnorr signatures that would be changes to Bitcoin itself would likely be in a ""soft fork"", i.e., a rule change where all old blocks remain valid, so there wouldn't be a chain-split.  Even if they were a ""hard fork"" that only results in a chain split if miners don't all upgrade."

Instead of calling 100 Satoshi = 1 Bit, institute a currency like naming convention.

100 Satoshi (or Sats) = 1 Satoshi Dollar (or Sdollar) = 1 Bit

Or instead of of currency, use SI prefixes, maybe HectoSatoshi? Or MicroBitconCash (µBCH?)

Edit: µBCH and Sats are already in use in the node software and most wallet software, so would require the least amount of code changes to make them default. Bits and Satoshi are already in wide use today so the best solution would probably be to go straight to Sats so we don't have to do this all over again in a few months/years."

4262,1515137039.0,"I would suggest that you figure out what you want to invest in (which coins you like), and at what percentages of your portfolio. 

For example.  Lets say you have $10,000 worth of crypto coins.  Maybe you want to be invested something like this:

>
* 50% BTC
* 10% LTC
* 25% ETH
* 10% Monero
* 5% Dash

So that would be 

>
* $5000 BTC
* $1000 LTC
* $2500 ETH
* $1000 Monero
* $500 Dash
 
(just pulling these coins out of thin air... you need to figure out which ones you want and in what proportions)

So, then once you have this, just wait a month, and then re-balance.  So maybe a month later your $10,000 is worth $12,000  But it will not be proportional. SO you take that $12k worth, and re-balance, so:

>
* $6000 in BTC
* $1200 in LTC
* $3000 in ETH
* $1200 in Monero
* $600 in Dash

Then just keep doing that.  If you decide you don't like a coin, just change it out.

In reality, you probably want to be in Silver and Gold as well, maybe some index funds, and good old cash.  But this is really about a Crypto portfolio."

That said I'm not sure we should jump to Satoshi. mBCH is currently a good default for wallets because it is in the same order of magnitude as USD, I have set my own wallet to this. It might recreate leading zeros in the future though. Unlike Satoshis, µBCH allows 2 decimal places like most fiat currencies.

My home country, Colombia, has had huge problems with land registries. There are 7 million people who have been forcibly removed from their homes, and even though things have gotten much better lately, and the government is trying to return the land to the original owners, there are huge problems with the records. A lot of times the ownership records have been lost, destroyed or tampered with, making it impossible to corroborate ownership. Even though the current government is decent in this sense, nothing stops a future government or a single actor tampering with the records and transferring possession to themselves.

Would the decentralized and unalterable nature of blockchain be a good fit for this kind of registry? Would it be particularly expensive to run such a system?

Sorry if it is a dumb question, I am a blockchain newbie, but this seems to be a real world application of blockchain technology with huge benefits, if I am understanding this correctly.

I am a computer science grad student and wanted to take a look at iOS development for quite some time, but I never found something that wasn't already on the app store. So this time I was out of excuses and luckily got some spare time during my winter break. I even fell sick and therefore was able to put a lot of time in it.

4348,1515138238.0,"there's nothing to stop the bots from syncing the blockchain from a checkpoint when they install themselves on a machine.

this would happen as quickly as they could download the ~32GB -- which admittedly is longer than the software starting by itself, but shorter than syncing it fresh and doing your own validation (the preferred method).

If having the blockchain becomes a bottleneck, storing it in memory will be trivial at best. You would see an even further concentration of hashing power into the hands of those who can afford terabyte-memory machines well into the future. Sure, people will be able to mine it on their SSDs, at home, at the expense of wearing out the SSD and with a lower hash rate, but not at nearly the rate others can with big hardware.

Finally, solving the botnet problem is easy if we want to talk about modifying the PoW: Push CPU miners out of the marketplace entirely. They already are one of the lowest cost-per-hash-per-second investments, GPU mining is where it's at; and if you increase the scratch pad to 4, 6, 8 or even 12MB -- most processors simply won't be able to mine it with any sufficient speed.

The bonus is that you'll push ASIC/FPGA development even further away, since the issue with that coming along today is that those platforms don't have fundamentally faster memory than the Vega 56/64 does.

This takes mining out of the mindless droves of machines, concentrates it into the hands of people who WANT to mine, and yes.. likely makes the GPU supply worse.


I'm sure there's a grand flaw with my idea, so I welcome all who know more to offer suggestions.

At any rate - Hi community! Yes, that was my first post. This is my second. I've been reading for a while, and had no reason to post until a short while ago, after I made my first successful BCN buy via the BCN wallet. I just started investing in crypto's a month ago, mostly in XRP, QSP, TRX. I liked BCN for a number of reasons, and frustrated like the rest of you that it was difficult if not impossible to purchase. 

When I recently read the post from Jenny that the wallet is working (new years present), I decided to give it a shot and transferred BTC from Binance. It worked well! Just as a note, I purchased over 200k.. not a tiny sum, not something ridiculously large either. 

I'm a former wallstreet trader of 10 yrs (hung it up after 2009 collapse, too stressful) and moved on to other things; so I'm not new to investing or reading charts, etc. I liked the recent spike in BCN volume above average, despite the fact its not available easily. Interest is there in this coin, and it has one of the best ideas/potential going for it, particularly relative to its incredibly modest price.

Anyway, Thanks again for all the great info and conversations that fueled my interest even further in BCN.. Looking forward to posting more here.

2. We have one of the best men in crypto in our corner. Say what you will about Charlie doing mainstream interviews or selling his holdings, but anyone who has been around long enough knows the kind of guy he is and he has stayed true the entire time. He came under fire for literally every tweet- if it provided a boost then people who missed it call insider trading, if it led to a decline then he was scrutinized for caring about BTC too much or not pumping his own coin. I'm not even a true litecoin OG, my first buys didn't come until the 20's but I've been around long enough to know that everything has stayed true to form along the way. Pay attention and you'll see Charlie hasn't changed up once through all the highs and lows which is one of the main reasons I truly believe 2018 can be even better than 2017 for us believers. 

3. Calm down, do your research, learn how this market works. This isn't traditional trading in any way and the only way you can be successful is by putting in the time. Sure Charlie could just shamelessly pump every chance he gets like Roger Ver does, but do you really think that will help us pass the test of time? Spend an hour looking at the past years ltc charts and learn what to expect, if you can't handle a run from 100 to 400 then a few weeks sideways at 220-250 then you will absolutely fail in the long run. *Understand that you will not become a millionaire overnight.* You hear the crypto success stories but do you take note on what they did to get there or do you just try to copy their portfolios and expect the same to happen to you?

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for everyone involved. We are in the midst of a full blown financial revolution that is changing the way people look at money and investing around the globe. 2017 we started to gain traction and get attention, imagine what lies ahead in 2018 once the general public and institutional money has no other choice but to get involved. Sit back and enjoy the ride. The next leg up is coming soon and when it does you'll laugh at yourself for sweating a couple sideways weeks #TrustTheProcess"

For those who haven’t got the chance to read part I please do so before reading this one: [NEM will surpass Bitcoin eventually, and here’s why and when!226](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-will-surpass-bitcoin-eventually-and-heres-why-and-when/7447)

This year has been like a living hell for most of us, especially to the long-term holders.  
FUD…FUD…FUD…and more FUD…be it China, Bitcoin spike…we’ve faced it all…and yet!..after all this here we are, popping champaign bottles and why?  
Well, let’s take a look at the facts. Since weak-hands tend to follow the hype and ride the wave, we, as investors eat popcorn while watching our investment grow on the long-term, as I personally believe this is the most stress-free and rewarding experience. But nevertheless, let’s take a look below:

Since last year in November, NEM averaged around 3500% increase  
Bitcoin on the other hand, only delivered around 640% increase

Now, I’m no science researcher but those figures make sense even if I had a stroke.

But main topic of the day…why is NEM surging?

Well, let’s put it this way…

Imagine you have Facebook on steroids with all goodies such as direct payments for utilities to shopping, and much more…can you imagine that? Well, that’s WeChat…and it’s China’s number 1 social media app.  
Now, what does that have to do with NEM? Especially when China banned cryptos…![:slight_smile:](https://forum.nem.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5) "":slight_smile:""

Well, here’s Lon Wong’s lesson in life: “if you have to fight it, at least make sure you win” and boy, he delivered!

Basically what he did, was to integrate the NEM’s wallet into WeChat as an add-on.

What does that mean?  
Well, every chinese who was prohibited to use cryptos, now can go rampage using NEM. And by the way, in case you didn’t know, WeChat has 1 BILLION active users.

But hey, let’s check the result of today’s spike: Market cap doubled…literally!  
Sure, it went all time high up to 65+cents and found support at ~50cents. Who cares? The launch of WeChat with NEM wallet integrated is on 21st December. Meaning that by deadline time, NEM should be no less than 1$ ! You know, I made a bet to all my friends and family saying that NEM will reach 45 cents before 2018. Well…I guess I fulfilled my prediction did I, as now I’m running on bonus?

During this year NEM partnered-up with many entities, no point of listing them but as far as I’'m concerned, the best one is the meat tracking service that NEM fuels in Japan for the government. Yes, we have Pundi-X, we have a papyrus of partnerships but overall…Japan government is our stamp of legitimacy for NEM being a viable solution for enterprise adoption, and more will follow, bet on that!

So, as for 8th of December NEM went +148% in market cap after months of no clue of where the ship is sailing, well, guess what, the ship just got a turbo-charger ! And it’s getting a couple more under the hood since Catapult comes at the end of February! The show is by far to be over!

Here’s what’s going to happen:

NEM went to 0.70$ all time high due to hype…finding support at ~0.50$  
WeChat+NEM wallet will launch on 21st December…meaning a hell lot of time to pump NEM  
After launch date, we might see a bit of a dip, but not much, as chinese guys have free path to buy NEM to trade it for whatever they want, I don’t care. And they come by billions ![:slight_smile:](https://forum.nem.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5) "":slight_smile:""  
Not far from that event, Catapult launches, the long-awaited NEM 2.0. Result?  
NEM will be 3-5$ by March 2018. So far my predictions were true. Wanna bet this one also?

All my predictions are based on some simple principles:

- NEM is above Bitcoin because of technology, as NEM is far more advanced.
- Bitcoin price is likely to enter in coma after Futures go live as everybody will short-sell.
- NEM has so much to offer in terms of adoption in enterprise use, that the closed beta-tests with banks in Japan that are happening right now, will result in partnerships very soon.
- When NEM will release Catapult on public blockchain with open-source as they promised, expect NEM to boom at an unimaginable rate. What you saw today, 145%+ price increase will seem like a foreplay. Expect apocalyptic gains with Catapult, and just as a bonus, don’t forget about NEM dedicated Australian Exchange ![:slight_smile:](https://forum.nem.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5) "":slight_smile:"" I’m not even mentioning COMSA here…Need more?
- NEM is in it’s DIPERS ! Yeah,still flying under the radar, yet,…it made huge gains with NO MARKETING and NO HYPE. Imagine when it goes mainstream !

2018 is NEM’s year and my God, I’m so glad I had the patience to HODL to my NEM even when odds were totally against me. 2018 is the year that will put NEM in top 3 Coinmarketcap’s chart. Just wait and see it for yourself.  
NEM will be 3-5$ in spring-summer.

I am always down for a good bet and for this one, I give myself 85% real chance to fulfil this prediciton.

Waiting for opinions my Nemsters, until then, Kudos!"

4419,1515139565.0,"Bitcoin takes power away from the government, and gives it to the people. Bitcoin not only takes away power from governments, but also makes the legacy banking system obsolete.

You think The Powers That Be will let this happen without a fight? Think again. Blockstream was formed for the purpose of stifling the growth of Bitcoin. No, they are not simply a greedy corporation that wishes to profit off of Bitcoin. The sole reason for Blockstream's existence is to cripple Bitcoin and make it useless.

The following people have all been Blockstream employees, and are Bitcoin Core developers (besides Adam Back):

* Adam Back (Co-Founder & former President, now Chief Executive Officer)
* Gregory Maxwell (Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer)
* Luke Dashjr (Co-Founder)
* Pieter Wuille (Co-Founder)
* Matt Corallo (Co-Founder)
* Jorge Timón (Co-Founder)
* Patrick Strateman

Blockstream received $76 million in funding from AXA, one of the largest multinational insurance corporations in the world, whose (former) CEO and Chairman, Henri de Castries, is also Chairman of the Steering Committee for the Bilderberg Group.

Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin was to allow massive on-chain scaling so the entire world could use it. The 1 MB block size limit exists only to intentionally create problems for Bitcoin, driving up the fees, and making the coin useless. Adam Back was added to Blockstream for the sole reason that he has some ""clout"" because he was mentioned in Satoshi's whitepaper. A new leader was needed to replace Satoshi, and fight against his vision. This is Adam Back.

The main communication channels (/r/Bitcoin, BitcoinTalk Forums, and Bitcoin.org) are all owned by a man named Michael Marquardt, AKA theymos. Theymos has most likely been threatened, or paid off by powerful people. /r/Bitcoin is completely censored for the purpose of controlling the narrative. The CSS of the subreddit was even drastically altered to hide the fact that hundreds of comments were being removed through systematic censorship. Any talk of raising the block size limit, or criticism of Blockstream or Core, will get you censored and banned. In order to take over Bitcoin, you must control the narrative, and trick people into thinking that crippling Bitcoin with high fees is a good thing.

Bitcoin XT was created to try and alleviate Bitcoin's scaling problems. When this project gained traction, and Coinbase started testing with Bitcoin XT, Coinbase was removed from Bitcoin.org. These intimidation tactics from the BlockstreamCore regime are extremely common. There have been too many of these social attacks to even list.  For example, Roger Ver is often called a scammer, a felon, and a convicted criminal who went to prison for selling explosives. These are the typical ad hominem attacks used. Roger Ver, along with thousands of other people sold harmless firecrackers on eBay. People play with firecrackers (at their own risk) for fun, and to have a good time. They are also technically explosives. The law on the sale of these was also never enforced, and many people bought them off eBay. So although Roger is technically a criminal, because he committed a ""crime"", and he technically DID sell ""explosives"", people try to make you think that maybe Roger was actually a dangerous domestic terrorist arms-dealer who sold explosives as weapons.

Projects like Bitcoin Unlimited were created in an attempt to fix the scaling problems in Bitcoin, and gained widespread community support. But talk of BU in /r/Bitcoin was disallowed. BU was attacked viciously in every way shape and form. The developers were accused of running a scam, trying to purposely centralize Bitcoin, etc. BU was a major threat, because it would take power away from BlockstreamCore, and make Bitcoin great again. BU on many different occasions was attacked using exploits in its code, to shutdown BU nodes. These attacks were almost certainly done by members of Core, like Greg Maxwell. These events were widely publicized by /r/Bitcoin in an attempt to shame BU and prove that the developers are incompetent.

Over time, many other blatantly obvious astroturfing campaigns took place in order to control the narrative. UASF, NO2X, AntBleed, and ASICBoost were all bogus astroturfing campaigns meant to stir up controversy where there was none, and to ""rally the troops"".

In the early months of 2017, I witnessed a ""community flippening"" occur, in which there were more hardcore/legitimate members of the Bitcoin community in /r/btc, than in /r/Bitcoin. People were waking up to the censorship and social attacks that were occurring. The people who remain in /r/Bitcoin at this point are mostly newbies who have just entered the space, useful idiots who can't think for themselves and have undying loyalty to Core, and paid shills.

After realizing that BlockstreamCore will never compromise, Bitcoin Cash was created to restore Satoshi's original vision. Bitcoin Cash was immediately attacked in many ways. It was called ChinaCoin in an attempt to trick people into thinking it's a centrally controlled Chinese scam coin. It was called Bcash (and sometimes Btrash) in an attempt  to take Bitcoin out of the name. When users posted about Bitcoin Cash in /r/Bitcoin, they were directed to post to the fake /r/Bcash subreddit. Bitfinex and Trezor even listed the coin as ""Bcash"" even though this just confused people more, as Bitcoin Cash was never referred to as Bcash by any of the development teams.

Bitcoin Cash was attacked relentlessly. When Coinbase and Bitstamp added Bitcoin Cash, /r/Bitcoin tried to rally the troops to boycott them. When the Bitcoin.com wallet added Bitcoin Cash, /r/Bitcoin attempted to rally the troops to leave hundreds of 1 star reviews on the app store.

Eventually a popular tipping bot called ""tippr"" was invented. Over a couple months, this gained massive traction and increased adoption substantially. Tippr was attacked in recent hacking attacks, where password reset links were sent to the emails of Reddit accounts, the passwords of these accounts were changed by the attackers, and then the Bitcoin Cash in their tippr balance was stolen. This was one of the greatest mistakes of the BlockstreamCore regime. It is now blatantly obvious that the email accounts of these users were not compromised. It is also unlikely that this is an exploit in Reddit itself. Reddit is the EIGHTH most popular website in the world, according to Alexa rank. A zero day exploit that allows ANY REDDIT ACCOUNT to be taken over, could potentially sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market. Yet the exploit was used to steal maybe $5,000 bucks tops, from a Bitcoin Cash tip bot? How come the tip bots of other cryptocurrencies were not targeted? The answer is because it wasn't about the money! Bitcoin Cash is one of the greatest threats in the cryptocurrency space, and it is being specifically targeted in many attacks. I don't expect Reddit to reveal any details of how the tippr hack was done.

Extremely powerful forces are behind the takeover of Bitcoin, and the attacks on Bitcoin Cash. For those of us that have been around a while, it's blatantly obvious what is happening."

Bitcoin - many scaling issues but at least not a scam; no premine, fair start that started the whole cryptospace

At the start of December I pledged to donate 25 Bitcoin, 1 each day leading up to Christmas, to a cause suggested by r/Bitcoin.
This was done publically in the hope to inspire others to donate too, especially people who have benefited from the rise in price recently.

&nbsp;

It took a long time to read every comment, private message and to check everyones suggestions.
Unfortunately not many suggested charities accept Bitcoin. 
I am posting this update so people can make suggestions for the last few donations and see a list of causes donated to so far.

&nbsp;

I am hoping that this post and donations will still encourage others in the community to give Bitcoin to good causes.

&nbsp;

##Get involved
Submit a suggestion in the comments of a cause you would like to see donated to. Also post a link to their Bitcoin donation page (not address) if possible.
Even if your suggestion is not donated to by me hopefully it may be seen by others here who may choose to donate.

&nbsp;

**I'll ignore any scams, begging, college fund requests etc.**  
**I don't donate to individuals so please don't post or PM.**
 

If you wish to give but don't have the time to check these posts for suggestions you can send Bitcoin to my address:
&nbsp;

**34WbSyrtibUJiFbRa7ukLC8RGdFMnQRn4b**
&nbsp;

I will divide the extra Bitcoin sent to that address by 25 and donate it to each of the chosen causes once all my 25 Bitcoin have been donated. 

Thanks to the people who have donated to my address so far.

##Proof of funds
Message: ""Give Bitcoin this Christmas""  
Address: 34WbSyrtibUJiFbRa7ukLC8RGdFMnQRn4b

Note that the address above doesn't contain 25 now due to sending donations so the funds moved to change addresses. 
You need to verify it using Trezor.

4488,1515140355.0,"First and foremost, I am a crypto investor, a tech enthusiast, and a developer. I have recently invested in whatever Reddit has been shilling, which includes TRON. Now, don't get me wrong, this coin has gotten me great returns thus far, but after a closer examination of its whitepaper and marketing, I am seriously doubting the legitimacy of this project.

Here are some specifics about the marketing that have caught my attention:

- the amount of futuristic buzzwords and abbreviations like ""Great Voyage"" or ""Star Trek"" to capture attention

- the recent partnership with game.com, which appears impressive, but is a shitty website recently created to promote TRON. Its only game, Cryptodoggies, is very superficial with almost no feature except the ability to purchase virtual pets with TRON. Take a look for yourself. 

In its whitepaper:

- 35% of coins go to the founders, while 10% of the initial coins go to Peiwo, a startup recently created by the founder of TRON.

- TRON claims that Peiwo is China's largest music content community with 10 million users and 1 million daily users, and will soon support TRX. This is a blatant lie; Peiwo is similar to game.com, a buzzword startup created by Justin to campaign this coin. Its App Store release only has 2,000 total reviews. Again, you can take my word or do some Googling for yourself.

Anyways, I encourage you all to do some research on this coin, and let me know if you agree or disagree!

Edit: upon some further digging, I have found similar concerns from other Redditors that didn't seem to raise any attention:

4565,1515141167.0,Hey guys any chance we see $1000 in 2018 lol
4566,1515141168.0,"Litecoin is #4 on both marketcap and tradevolume of the minable coins, it has been around since around 7 years or so, it has the best performance characteristics (fees, blocktime etc), it is very much alive!! If one crytocoin is set for a digital currency it is LTC.  BTC is dead, it is too expensive and slow. It's spin-offs are not credible and everything else is more or less a laughing stock. The value proposition of LTC has never been better than before. 

Now percentage wise there are about equal #of btc and #ltc mined out of the total number that will ever exist. But many more ltc are in circulation, about 5x (check bitinfocharts.com). Also, ltc and btc will deplete at around the same rate at the same time. So in reality, as branding of LTC will continue there is an enourmous uplift potential. I would say around 10k$/20 = 500$ must be within reach (10k being realistic for btc and 20=4x5, 4 because of the 4x larger number of coins, 5 because of the higher percentwise volume in circulation).

However, The best thing that can happen for adoption is for the price to increase at a modest pace instead of up/down by 100% every month.  the same for BTC. Seriously, noone is waiting either for the USD to crash or explode in value re other fiat currencies either. The price increase reflects the interest wider adoption for usefull things, and compensates to some extend for the increase in mining power. 

Right now LTC is trading at ca 64LTC/BTC, but it has been almost down to 50, so there is at least a potential of 20%+ price appreciation relative to BTC. 

I think LTCs future is bright. 

What we're lacking is easy (and relative cheap) ways to get hands on LTC. The easier it is for anyone to buy LTC __directly__ (from USD, EUR, UKP, Yen, etc) the better. It is improving but that is where BTC is miles and miles ahead of LTC."

4583,1515141325.0,"I wouldn't even say it's based on token weight because Aragon will allow for modular governance that could be a hybrid of reputation, curation markets, token weight, quadratic voting as well as many other possible governance structures. I have committed to not explaining the value of tokenized governance and have decided to really push for an understanding of the theories and models that make everything possible. Until this is understood explaining anything else seems to be in vain. 

Similar to bitcoin and blockchain in general, people have a lot to learn before they will understand the token model we are employing. 

The standard response I give is as follows: 

DNT is required to be a part of the network in many ways. The district0x Network Token is a multi-utility token which is required for application to the district0x Network, will be utilized in an incentivized voting game to dictate access to a suite of supplementary services exclusive to network members, used to signal support or disapproval for proposals made by network participants, and will be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing district-specific voting rights in corresponding Aragon entities. 

---

While this does describe the token utility in full detail and leaves little more to describe, I think this is all that can be said until people see these tools first hand. Lke bitcoin, a lot makes sense when using it long before it will be understood through multiple explanations said in different ways in hopes it will become clearer. 

I would say just learn what you can personally because if someone has not done the research required to understand the theories and models in full, there is nothing more you can do until they can use it themself. 

I do appreciate your effort to help with this though, it is for sure a major learning gap for people but that is the primary reason we're working on an educational portal. I think this is really the only solution because we can guide people through all the theories and models regardless of the level of understanding. "

Electron Cash 3.1 is ready for windows and linux.  

The big change is the new address format, known as CashAddr. Also has a cool toggle feature plus an address converter.  

Also, we reduced the fee slider so the minimum fee is 1 satoshi per byte. Lower fees are possible with manual setting.

I also introduced a safety feature so that it SHOULD be impossible to send more than 50 sat/byte.  I'm tired of hearing the stories about the people that accidentally paid an 80 BTC fee or something.  Hopefully it stops some people from shooting themselves in the foot.

Mac version with CashAddr support should be coming in 1-2 days.  The android version will need a lot of work so no immediate plans to support CashAddr, but hopefully within a month -- we'll see.  At the very least we'll publish a new android version with the low fees and possibly integrated QR scanner.

I was just wondering if anyone was running a dual opteron CPU/gpu mining rig?

I'm planning on doing a dual opteron and 5x Vega 56 build and wondering if there should be issues or concerns I should be aware of before going this route?

Planned hardware: 
2xOpteron 6276 processors
Asus KGPE-D16 motherboard
2x32gb ecc ddr3 memory
5xVega 56 gpus
2x750w evga g2 psu's

The motherboard has 4 pci-e slots and 1 pci slot. I'm still not sure if it is able to support 5 gpu's for mining. The reason I'm going for this combo is that I plan to use the CPU/motherboard/ram later on for a hacking/pen test lab and want a motherboard that supports core boot also for that reason. 

I'm estimating my h/s around 10k with this build. I will flashing Vega 64 bios on all cards and using custom power tables so power consumption should be around 1000w for everything.

4914,1515145509.0,"It's entrance into the agricultural and food sectors.

When people think of farmers they usually think of migrant workers, hillbilly’s, dirt and the smell of manure.

What is often overlooked is industrial-scale farming is very scientific, and very technological. Everything is measured out precisely.

From the genetically modified seeds to the pesticides, herbicides and fungicides used – today more than ever, advancements in technology are crucial to making sure the population can sustain itself.

Technology is most apparent in the agricultural industry through controlled atmosphere cold storage and temperature controlled shipping. To ensure maximum freshness and longevity of fruits and vegetables, temperatures and relative humidity are kept at very specific levels depending on the crop being stored. The ethylene levels are also measured and in many cases artificially lowered or “sucked out”. Temperature monitoring systems have also been developed to ensure the cold-chain is being kept every step of the way. All of this allows temperature sensitive fruits and vegetables to travel across continents and oceans while maintaining their quality and freshness. Because of these breakthroughs and meticulous handling, consumers around the world can enjoy nearly any fruit or vegetable at any time of the year.

VeChain is breaking into this industry, and dare I say have the potential be as big a breakthrough and emerging technology as cold-storage and cooling systems were? So how can VeChain impact the agricultural sector?

Unlike a lot of other industries and sectors, the agricultural sector is one that has been waiting for blockchain to come to their aid for years. They welcome blockchain not with skepticism but with open arms and a welcome gift – a way for blockchain technology to prove itself in the real world. A world full of doubt and critics.

One of the biggest problems in the agricultural supply chain is transparency. And blockchain solves this.

1. Total visibility. With blockchain, every event that occurs in the supply chain can be a recorded transaction, chronologically logged and visible to every participant. Each timestamped transaction—from activity in the field to delivery at the store—is linked to a previous block and can be viewed or added to, but the data that’s already recorded cannot be changed.
2. Security. Blockchain uses cryptography that ensures records and transactions can’t be changed or counterfeited, so no party can cheat the system—there’s one source of truth. And, because blockchain is decentralized and distributed, with millions of personal computers holding the record blocks submitted by other users, it’s difficult for a hacker to take down or corrupt the system.
3. Traceability. Blockchain’s unshakable record of every transaction makes it a natural support system for food safety and traceability. This visibility to a commodity’s movement through all stages of processing and distribution can play an important role in preventing contaminated food from reaching consumers.
Blockchain creates universally transparent transactions, but what does that mean for fresh produce and the cold chain? With blockchain technology, all parties involved can see all events in the supply chain, from field to consumer. Consider, for example, the clarity, planning power, and product knowledge you’d have if you could see everything that has to do with the produce you need in your store. With blockchain, you could see which seed varieties were used, planting times and conditions, yield forecasts, harvest information, packing updates, and shipment details.

VeChain will change the world. In the future people may or may not use crypto as a currency. They may or may not play Tron Dogs. They may or may not gamble on the blockchain. But what WILL happen, is implementation into the supply chain - in particular perishables and highly temperature sensitive commodities.

The fact that VeChain is one of the few projects out there that have even bothered to tackle this issue is mindblowing, and at the same time a vote of confidence into their vision and knowledge."

Bitcoin was conceived to bypass legacy banks in 2007 after the door closes to USA customers for on-line casinos and threats of closure for on-line ""binary options"" [= casino bets under the guise of so-called investment.]

July 16 2007 was the trigger event that created the chain reaction that was the 2008 meltdown. That's when 2 hedge funds sponsored  by Bear Sterns, specializing in leveraged casino bets on debt deviratives collapsed into insolvency. .. 

the canary gasps for breath in the stifling swamp of global banking.... 

meanwhile as the legacy bankers totter forward in time, two well-funded trojan horse operatives  have been positioning themselves to gain commit access: Pieter ?  W  in jan-2011 and  Greg  ? in feb-2012. That gives  them several more years to stretch their street-cred before they need to wield their 2 ""veto"" votes in order to neutralize the votes of Gavin A for alpha and Jeff G for gamma that threaten to subvert 2 of the most critical variables : the incumbent blocksize and the consensus-veto protocol that had been installed under the tutelage of blockstream loyalists Greg and Pieter ably supported by their boss Adam B for beta. 

the greek ? = beta is used typically in regression analysis to help us understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (fees e.g.}  changes when some of the independent variables ( block weight e.g.) are varied, while the most critical variables ( narrative, blksize and consensus-veto  protocol e.g. are held fixed.

the greek ? = gamma for Garzik is the symbolic camel bending down to enter the archway with a height of 2 meg, when the push comes to the shove as happened in oct-2017. Then in early nov-2017, the archway of 2 meg proved too difficult and dangerous to negotiate even with the maximum bend possible so that all attempts to enter had to be abandoned.... 

the greek ? = pi for Piieter, denotes mastery of circuituous  logic which gives a semblance of certainty [314]

the greek ? = mu for Maxwell G, deniotes the micro measurement that would stand 100 times bigger than the humble sat.

fast forward to 2017...After an exhausting and exhaustive critique of the ecosystem, a critical mass of early adopters waken up and start plotting  en masse a la fork and so on the first of august 2017 they manage to deliver their coup de grâce to the not so well-behaved singularity that was once monolithic bitcoin.

The problem with market cap is it's not actually a measure of how much money has gone into the system. It's just a simple multiplication of supply times current price. But most people originally bought in at well below the current price. At any given time, there's been a relatively low volume of people willing to buy at the market price. Not at $1000/BTC, $10,000 BTC, or $100,000 BTC, there's only a bit of volume and some day traders trying to buy upwards. The rest of the circulating supply is in the hands of long term hodlers, who bought it at a lower price.

So yeah, the market cap is the problem, but the actual number doesn't really matter. If people try to liquidate 10 million bitcoins tomorrow, they will find out only the first ~2 million or so get bought at any price, and after that it's free fall."

Imagine a world where you get paid directly from your employer into an app on your phone holding your LTC. You go to your local small business and keep you wallet in your car. You pay directly to the merchant for what you bought. 
You drive and get gas and transfer your LTC to the gas station attendant through your phone. Then you go down the street and see a yard sale. You like 5 items that cost a total of $125. You pay in LTC instead of heading to the atm. 
You pay your landlord with LTC instead of mailing a check. 
You are 200 miles from home and your car breaks down. The cost is $2,000 but you don't have the LTC. You call your spouse/friend/parent and they send you the funds instantly, or pay the bill directly. 
Your friend lost his wallet on the other side of the planet. You send them LTC instantly to cover immediate expenses. You are arrested (it wasn't yours, you were holding it for a friend) and you need bail.  You send the bond person the funds instantly, no need to involve your wife. 
It's your birthday and your grandmother sends you a card with a transfer address instead of mailing you cash or a check. 
No chancing down coworkers to pay for those girlscout cookies.
No gofundme fees when fundraising for your charity. 
Easier way to receive funds for your side business. 
No credit card fees, no lost checks, no question if the check is going to bounce. Nearly instant, low cost transactions without having to deal with banks that fee you to death. 
This is what crypto is. This is what litecoin is. It's not a matter of if, but when this happens. As word gets out, it will grow. The demand will be huge. 
1,000, 000,000 working adults with an average holding of $3,000 is 3 trillion dollars, and that's on the low end. If LTC is 5% of that market is $2,000 per LTC at 84 million circulation. This is all low numbers too. This is the future.

5074,1515147621.0,"I wanted to take a minute to reflect on some thoughts looking back over the last year and some predictions going forward into 2018. I’ve been into bitcoin since 2011, but this past year I finally took the plunge and became a full time investor/trader in the spring after leaving my cushy software engineering job. It turned out to be about the best decision I could have made, as I started heavily investing in a variety of coins back in spring when the rally was just getting started. It’s been a whirlwind 9 months trying to keep up with the markets, but I feel my efforts paid off, as I closed the year up 4x in term of Bitcoin and about 50x USD. My main fear was that I would put in hundreds of hours and would have just been better off holding Bitcoin, so I’m glad all my hard work paid off.

&nbsp;

One thing I became very aware of this year is to pay attention to the macro environment in the markets, and not get tunnel vision for certain coins. In hindsight I didn’t pay enough attention to the high demand for BTC because of all the free money forks, because I was too busy researching and investing in alts. I was paying a lot of attention to individual coins, but when the market went against alts during the BTC rally, I was left dumb founded, only to realize I hadn’t paid enough attention to the meta game within the market.


I’ve now noticed that there are trends in the overall market, just like in all markets, but in crypto they come and go in months or weeks, rather than years like in the stock market. Here are my thoughts on some of the bigger trends I’ve observed.

&nbsp;


**ICO Flipping**

A lot of people made a killing flipping ICOs earlier this year, but it seems like that easy money is mostly gone for now. More recently a lot of ICOs have gotten dumped upon hitting the exchanges. It was bound to happen, when something is that easy everyone will pile on until it’s no longer profitable. The cool thing about ICOs was that it allowed small time investors access into early stage investments. Something that was never really possible before, and only the privileged with millions of cash and connections could have. Well, I think going forward flipping will once again become a game for the large holders with connections. I think if you want to flip an early stage coin you’re going to have to get in way before ICO, and then sell to all the chumps who buy once it hits the market.

&nbsp;

**Penny coin pumps**

This is a current market mechanic that many, myself included, are very salty about. It’s one of those thing, where in hindsight we should have seen it coming and made a killing. Normies have been entering the market for a while now, and it makes sense that when you have thousands of people that know nothing about crypto, they’re going to pick the “cheap” coins. People want those 100x gains that others have gotten, and they don’t think they’ll be able to get it with the bigger coins. This will eventually come to an end, but who knows how long it can go on for.

&nbsp;

**Alts pump when bitcoin goes sideways**

I think people in these markets are addicted to crazy gains, I know I certainly am. It gets boring when you’re not doubling your money every week, so when bitcoin stalls people get their money into other coins to get that dopamine fix again. I think this is a trend that will persist for some time to come, as we’re all collective junkies for huge gains.

&nbsp;

**Look alike coins**

Another market trend I’ve witnessed many times is that when one coin pumps big, it’s often followed days later by coins with similar tech. This happened very recently with ripple and stellar, and there are a host of other examples. I think this is a trend that will likely continue although lessen as investors become more savvy and begin noticing that many look alikes are not all they’re sold to be. For example, people got a taste of this with the recent XVG privacy fiasco, and are learning that while many privacy coins look alike, few actually offer real privacy.

&nbsp;

And here are some of my predictions for this year.

&nbsp;


**XRB will emerge as the coin for inter-exchange transfers**

I have accounts on around 8 exchanges, and I must say that no matter how many times I send or receive cryptos from exchanges, it always makes me extremely nervous. Waiting around for hours while my money is in limbo is terrifying, and causes me a great deal of stress. Right now we’re seeing a very rapid growth in exchanges listing XRB, and I expect this to continue and greatly accelerate this year. Once it’s on most exchanges it’s only natural that it will become the preferred method of moving money between exchanges. And, once it’s the preferred method for moving money between exchanges, I expect to see many more XRB pairs, which will further drive adoption. It could well become the traders coin. This of course, is all assuming someone doesn’t figure out how to attack the coin and destroy it, as the tech is still not battle hardened.

&nbsp;

**NEO will jump up the ranks**

One main promise of crypto was to be able to do financial business outside of the realm of government controlled currencies. One of the biggest uses for this we saw this year was in ICOs, and they’re coming to NEO very fast. I think NEO will trace a trajectory similar to what ETH has already done as we see an exponential increase in the number of ICOs on the platform. A crypto economy that supports high value financial business like venture capital via ICOs is going to have a lot of demand, as ETH has already proven.

&nbsp;

**ETH with go to $2k-$5k**

There is tons of stuff in the pipeline coming out, including PoS, which will give more incentive for people to hold. ETH still has one of the biggest developer communities in this space, and this will help drive innovation. It’s also becoming a secondary safe haven coin to BTC and many big holders will be parking their money in it.

&nbsp;

**Coins without fundamentals may die** 

Or they may not. As much as I want scams like EOS to die off, the fact is that many of these coins raised hundreds of millions during ICO, which gives them runway to burn for years to come. As long as they can keep conning people into believing in the dream, it could go on for years. However, I do expect to see some of the worst offenders shaken down the ranks, like BTG.

&nbsp;

**Thoughts on Bitcoin going forward**

The sense I’m getting is that a lot of new money entering the market isn’t that interested in Bitcoin. They see it as dated tech without the chance to get them 100x gains. So, I think for a lot of small time investors entering the market that aren’t very knowledgable they will mostly buy other coins. However, if you’re looking to park a lot of money in crypto (millions) you really have no choice but to use the bigger coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. I think we’re going to see more big names coming out saying they’re buying big chunks of Bitcoin, just like Peter Thiel did. Also, I think we’ll see a lot of people taking profits from alts and putting it back into bitcoin, as a lot of people are reluctant to cash out and deal with the tax man. The optimism in the market right now is driving people to keep money within the ecosystem, which makes a store of value coin like Bitcoin very useful.


I think we’ll start to see lighting get rolled out this year, and eventually see a shift in the tide of thinking Bitcoin is dated and past its prime. I expect to see $40k-$60k for Bitcoin by the end of the year. In my mind, it’s value proposition is still huge. It’s the one and only battle hardened crypto that has stood the test of time. If lightning can succeed, it will make a rock solid base layer for the crypto economy.


&nbsp;


**My strategy going forward** 

I’m a bit burned out on hyper focusing on the markets for the last 9 months, so I’m going to be doing more holding in 2018. I’ll be holding most of my portfolio in BTC, ETH, NEO, XMR, and XRB. I’ll be on the lookout for novel technology to invest in, but staying away from most business tokens. I’m interested in investing in open platforms/protocols, and I think in the long term that’s where the most money is to be made. Of course, you can make much higher percent returns chasing the latest hype, but quite frankly I’m tired of that game.


Happy trading to you all. I feel very grateful that I’m a part of this crazy movement and that I get to share in it with a bunch of crazies from all over the world. I'll be at the BTC Miami conference later this month and hope to meet some of you there."

5115,1515148300.0,"While it's true that the coin emission rate will remain high until 2020, Zcash is one of the lowest supply coins in the crypto space with ~3 million ZEC mined to date . If you compare that to the other top 25 coins, you'll see Zcash is currently the most scarce coin by a wide margin. If crypto investors ever decide to rotate into ZEC for any reason, there could be some very sharp moves higher.

Additionally, the main reason why ZEC is currently undervalued is the uninformed crypto investor. Today the majority of people who invest in cryptocurrency are extremely ignorant in regard to the underlying technology. The main proof of this is the fact that people still think Bitcoin is anonymous, when in fact it is the opposite of anonymous. If the masses ever figure this out, they'll be able to see the value proposition of Zcash. It's entirely possible that ZEC will trade at parity with BTC again one day.

TL;DR Yes. ZEC is one of the most undervalued coins in the crypto space.

This is my first time buying any form of Crypto.  My goal was to get some XRB by buying BTC and transferring it to BitGrail to exchange it.  I bought $100 CAD worth of BTC which resulted in .00448312 BTC in my Electrum wallet.

After receiving the bits in my Electrum wallet, I immediately sent the bits over to BitGrail under the assumption I'd be able to buy maybe 2 XRB after fees.  I chose the ""within 10 blocks"" option on Electrum as I was hoping to get the most out of my money.  About 20 minutes after sending to BitGrail I only received a small portion of my BTC I sent, not even enough to buy a single XRB.

I started with .00448312 BTC, transferred it over to BitGrail under the assumption I'd have around .003 BTC to buy XRB with, but on BitGrail I have .00075129 BTC.  Did I make a newbie mistake and somehow turned my $100 CAD into $11~ CAD in a few minutes?  Thankfully this was the remainder of my Christmas money and I'm not too chuffed about losing it, but it would be nice to know what went wrong for future transactions.

5136,1515148615.0,"**INTRODUCTION**

Let me explain - if you don't know anything about the coin, ELIX can be roughly broken down as follows:

1. A mobile wallet sending/receiving platform

2. A crowdfunding platform

3. A peer 2 peer lending platform

Now, the 1st part is nothing new - this is being done by a whole range of coins - neither are the 2nd and 3rd parts.

But, that's the beauty of it - it's a proven model that has made a LOT of founders rich.

To put it simply, Crowdfunding and P2P Lending have **blown** up over the last few years in the startup world, outside of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

However, both are perfectly suited to a decentralized p2p blockchain solution, which is exactly what Elixir is offering.

**Why ELIX?**

1. An actual, useful use-case: It's aiming to become a service where friends and family can service loans easily, and when completed, both the lender, and the loantaker are rewarded
2. Active and communactive devs: This is hard to get these days. These guys posts on their Telegram daily, and are actively sharing their progression
3. Realistic but incredible roadmap: They just released their website, which looks gorgeous, and their team (which I will come back to). Their mobile app is being released in Q1, and they have already shown us the software in action. 
4. Extremely low mcap: Inevitably an important factor as well. I personally believe this is one of the most underrated coins available at the moment, considering the transparent developer team, that they have a working demo, and that they've met our expectations brilliantly so far.

**COMPETITORS**



It's biggest competitor is SALT, which is residing at 691mil mcap, while ELIX is currently at 28mil. I believe this ratio is skewed, as when you compare the two, ELIX has numerous advantages, such as;

- Not geographically restricted (Only US citizens can use SALT, anybody can use ELIXIR)
- Allows for any type of loan (SALT's lower bound is 5k$)
- Allows for anonymous lending (SALT's user must through a membership review to be eligible to use the platform)
- Completely decentralized 
- Completely feeless
- Incentivizes lending (ELIX rewards users of their platform with tokens on the completion of a loan).
- Uses their tokens for lending (SALT's tokens has no actual value, they're effectively stocks)

But regardless of the unit, people should use the opportunity now of this new address format coming on the 14th. It's a meaningful UI change, organized among different wallets. It's the best moment to change the default unit. If all main wallets plus Bitpay (it makes sense for them due to prices in smaller units looking better) do it, eventually exchanges and all wallets will follow.

You shouldn't even need to change the name. ""New BCH"" is good enough. That's how many governments with hyperinflation have done, obviously in the other direction, and it works fine (I lived through it in Brazil)."

Not sure if there is another site like shapeshift where I can enter the addresses and go from there. I tried poloniex, maybe I just don't know how to use it, but it seems like I would have to deposit my coinbase btc in first then convert that separately into XMR?

So I want to clarify two parts:

**1)** you cannot transfer NEP-5 assets unless you update the app on the ledger, the transaction will fail. This is because the ledger app for NEO version 1.0 didn't support ""invoke"" transactions. There was also a bug in the app where it would sometimes hang on signing the transaction (can ""deny tx"", cannot ""sign tx"") so updating to 1.1.1 is recommended.

If it's working for you, and you'd rather not update, that's fine. If you get caught by the the bug, then update (or use the recovery site to recover your wif and work around it).

Game.com was not created by Sun which you seem to want to imply (""Peiwo is similar to game.com, a buzzword startup created by Justin"").

Valuation is too high right now I agree. What makes me think that Tron will be successful is Sun's connection to the founder of Alibaba and former senior employees of Alibaba working for Tron now.

Could we please have working products BEFORE we start the pump guys???

Anyway, in reality the situation is more complex than OP stated, as this isn't just some penny stock pump.

Here's a chart for US Smartphone & tablet adoption: https://imgur.com/5x6m85e (source: http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/)

Notice anything? It's pretty steep really (for the time frame covered)! If you had invested in the right stocks & rode the wave up your returns would be incredible. Didn't make it a bubble either - new tech might overheat in terms of enthusiasm but it seldom just vanishes again. Doesn't look much different from the BTC or ETH charts eh? Starts from 0, runs up a long way?

So IMHO what we're seeing is a combination of a) A speculative bubble (I'm also getting a bit bearish in the short-medium term) and b) a technology adoption curve (and for THAT I'm extremely bullish). So will it slow? Pop (ala dot com bust)? Or sprint higher, with the coins/tokens of winning tech just smoothly levelling out to their real value as the 'unicorns' emerge?

Right now, the honest truth is that NOBODY knows where this is going or what the rules are - there are NO real experts yet. Not me, not OP, not Buffet, not Satoshi. It's just too damn new. Given that I'm here, and happy to hold my current positions (in addition to a bit of day trading) obviously my instinct is that it'll be a bit of a correction followed by a smoother growth as real-world use cases grow & end-user products are released - but this is totally new territory and I'm really using as much instinct as logic in this. Old metrics of economic valuation just don't apply in the same way. This isn't stocks, derivatives or forex - it's a whole new asset class combined with a whole new technology. This is almost closer to buying up domains during the dot com era, then flipping them at massive profit margins - when you buy a coin or token you're staking out a piece of tech that some developer (maybe me!) is going to have to pay a premium for at some point in the future, to build a real-world application.

Personally, since I'm a developer (in fintech for a few years now) I'm thinking as much from a tech perspective as the economic. I've seen this type of explosion before - and I agree while there'll be a calming/correction at some point, long term this sets off all my ""gonna be big"" instincts - the same way smart phones and web sites did.

And this isn't my first rodeo either, so here's a cautionary tale: As an investment Noob back in the Dot Com era. I panic sold everything I had in the crash. My first time investing - I had no clue at all really. I still believed in what TV news etc had to say and was scared of losing my money. Had I just held & believed in what I'd picked over what the media FUD was spreading (especially my Amazon, Google etc), I'd be retired by now probably. So even IF this is a bubble, if you're already up in profits - be happy! Maybe cash out enough to cover your initial position for some peace of mind, then settle in for the long ride.

TLDR; Don't pay attention to either FOMO or FUD right now. Pick the tech you genuinely believe in, buy it up (with money you can afford to lose!), and chill. If you're coming to this from other markets, as a speculator or just from more of an economics/finance background - then get some piece of mind by focusing on the tech itself too. There ARE real fundamentals to look at here (network speed, security, transaction costs, energy usage, security, privacy, utility) beyond just chart movements and TA. "

You could also check it out on an online explorer (like [blockexplorer.com](https://blockexplorer.com)) by searching for your transaction ID or address to see what happened.

I have been running a Vega rig successfully for over a month now with 4 x Powercolor Vega 64's running just over 2KH/s each. (8420 H/s Total)

I picked up another Sapphire Vega 64 and have tried adding it in to the system but its totally unstable now and will constantly drop out of xmr-stak.

Booting it up it runs fine for about 30 seconds (and I can see that juicy 10KH/s) but then suddenly the screen will flash, the card will bottom out (lights on GPUTach will reduce to 1) and then it will no longer be running in xmr-stak.

I have done the usual DDU - Reinstall Blockchain - Crossfire Regedits - Soft Power Play (to 1100) then attempt to run again. Even with low intensity or 1 thread on the 5th Sapphire card it just simply will not run.

Someone mentioned that it can become unstable with cards over 4, so I have tried to remove a Powercolor and have a Sapphire in its place - but this has made no difference either.

For reference the build uses:

    AsRock H110 Pro BTC+
    8GB DDR4 RAM
    M.2 Drive
    Intel G3930 2.90 GHz
    2 x Corsair HX1200i PSU (4 powered by one, 1 by the other)
    PCIe Risers
    4 x Powercolor Vega64
    1 x Nvidia GTX970
    1 x Sapphire Vega64
    Windows 10

This coin is one of the growing list of coins that scares me and not in a good way. Now, I can't fault someone for profiting off of it, that's fine. Congratulations on your lucky pick. However, I cannot for the life of me see it's value. I have tried to very fairly read their whitepaper, visit their site,  YouTube it, and visit their reddit. There is nothing there. The reddit community is garbage, whatever people may have seen the vision are wiped away by the lambo moon crowd that has no idea what they are holding and youtube is loaded with youtubers analyzing it and throwing money into it without any reasoning behind their actions.

I believe this is a legitimate project, and a lot of the issues you bring up are due to TRON being focused mainly at being implemented in China. The futuristic buzzwords may seem corny, and the white paper may seem disjointed, but the message probably comes across much cleaner in Chinese. All of the partnerships TRON has made as far as I know are based in Asia or Europe. He wants American and European investors, but the reality is they are not needed.

I do believe this project is overhyped right now. I don't think it will see any success in the West competing against the Ethereum, Cardano, and ARK platforms. But TRON is in prime position in China. My biggest concern right now is what effect Zuckerberg might have moving into the crypto realm. If he can implement TRON's vision into the already established Facebook network, no one will have a reason to switch onto the new TRON platform. But that is speculation for the long term future. In the short term, TRON is very promising and you would be foolish to sell now. Just my 2 Tronix."

5582,1515153315.0,"With the Tron Foundation TRX locked up until 2020, he's likely using his other apps resources to fund this endeavor, with the goal of integrating the two things.   So it's not really that surprising that he will pay back the money he took out of his other company. 

Here's a comment about TRON i made a week or so ago, before this explosion in price:

""Tron Foundation want to be a platform for multiple use cases across a wide variety of industries, and have them all connected within a decentralized shared economy. They want to build Web 4.0 and take on Google, Apple and Facebook as a content distribution platform. Giving the power back to the people to decide their own pricing, distribution, and economic models and control every aspect of their own creations and content. Instead of giving Google or Apple 40% you'd just pay the content creator directly for things, in one payment, or broken into micropayments or a mix of both, totally up the publisher. There are so so so many possibilities here.. This is starting to be represented in their partnerships.. Weibo (10 million users) a Chinese social media app, Gifto (20 million users) a decentralized gifting platform, oBike (10 million users) a bike sharing platform (more partnerships coming according to the CEO).. Using TRX as a transferable currency between ALL partners and apps built and connected to TRON will be huge. It's also going to be added to multiple new exchanges within the coming weeks and months including (almost 100% sure) Bittrex and Bitfinex.

TRX is designed to be an inter-game currency for all games built on their platform. Meaning instead of holding CNY, USD, CAD, AUD (as well as all other crypto currencies) etc and having wallet dust in various games, you will be able to use your TRX in one wallet and seamlessly transfer it between games. One account, one currency.

It's going to be absolutely massive given the popularity of mobile gaming and micro payments. Content creators will be able to publish their own games, set their own method of distribution, and their own prices. They will earn TRX based on whatever parameters and rules they set from people buying and playing their games. It will be a huge component in the self sustaining multi use case decentralized economy they are seeking to build.

Keep in mind the creator of Clash of Kings is one of the investors in Tron. Partnerships with mobile gaming companies are something i fully expect for Tron in the future. This will add millions of daily users, and open up those games to all holders and users of TRX.

The oBike partnership is another aspect of this shared economy. Users will be able to pay for rides with ocoin and earn it as they ride, this can be used on the Tron platform within the decentralized economy. Pretty sure they can either spend their ocoins on everything or they can easily transfer it to TRX to spend elsewhere across the platform. Same goes the other way, someone could theoretically take money from their gaming account and transfer it to ocoin to ride a bike, earn ocoins from riding that bike, and then transfer back into a game and spend them there on an item.

'In 2016, the global video game market was to $ 9.66 billion, of which the scale of the phone game market was $ 4.61 billion, accounting for 42%. TRON provides the possibility for establishing an on-line game platform. Developers can freely set up game platforms through TRON, achieve crowd funding for game development, and common investors can contribute to game content creation'. - From the Tron [whitepaper]
(https://dn-peiwo-web.qbox.me/Tron-Whitepaper-1031-V18-EN.pdf)
The first game to be released will be TRX dogs, but over time as the platform evolves developers will launch more sophisticated titles that appeal to a broad range of people.

The data storage and distribution aspect will be fantastic for sharing video, photos and articles free from censorship due to the distributed nature of the ledger.

Tron will build a massive user base across a wide variety of uses cases and industries, have them all interconnected, and build a self sustaining decentralized economy that ANYONE can participate in across the globe.

There is also something called Tron Power:

“TP is locked TRON. Users can acquire TP by locking their TRONIX. TP, in nature, is TRONIX with voting rights, which means TP holders have more privileges in the ecosystem… TRON tries to build an ecology under the full control of TRON holders who are optimistic about TRON on a long-term basis, and we hope TRON could be controlled by those whose values are consistent with TRON’s over the long term. As time passes, we’ll give TP holders more TPs as a reward, and the reward will be dynamically allocated. This means that those who hold and lock TP for the long term will be rewarded. TRON POWER’s balance cannot be transferred nor sold, which means TRON POWER is not tradeable.’’

Tron has a 10 year roadmap and a plan to take things step by step and build all the different aspects of this platform. It has a solid team behind it, a bit of a rockstar CEO who excels at promoting his product, and a growing list of investors and partnerships. It's being designed for 100 million plus users and is a long term hold.

Here's the crazy think, most of these 'investors' think that a cheap coin (sub $50 but pref sub $10) gives them the best chance of hitting the big time. They have no concept of total supply or what it even means. I saw one fuck-nut shilling XRP at $1000... that's like a third of the global money supply sucked in to Ripple - WHAT THE FUCK PEOPLE?!

Sure you shouldn't pay the host at the end of the contract if the uptimes were very low, but if I'm a renter, and I have a 30/10 contract, I can have some volatility without it hindering the access to my data.  In fact, I can have 20 hosts shut down and still be able to get my data and a new 20 hosts will be given the data to get me back to a 30/10 redundancy.  Anyways, I figured this was a good place to discuss this and get some insight from people that had a better idea of this than I do.

5679,1515154278.0,"Apparently, I'm the only motherfucker who actually reads Chinese here, so let me share with you guys what I've found on Chinese sites regarding ?? (Peiwo)

1. It's at least 2 years old according to [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/28567929), a Chinese Quora/Yahoo like site. The OP there is asking what does everyone think of the Peiwo App, and the topmost upvoted answer was posted on 2017-03-25, saying she used it for two years and got off because too many weirdos started using it.
2. What the fuck does the app do? To put it bluntly, you get people to voice/video chat with you, and there's a section where you can pay to do that. Source: [Chinese Baidu Wiki](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%AA%E6%88%91/15896151?fr=aladdin)
3. Date first available on Appstore: 2014-9-15 Source: [Chinese Baidu Wiki](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%AA%E6%88%91/15896151?fr=aladdin)
4. User count: Who the fuck knows?  But let's do this. Baidu has a message board system called Tieba. If I compare the Tieba user count and message count of Peiwo to a different, similar app, that's gonna give you a rough idea right? So Peiwo's [message board ](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%C5%E3%CE%D2&fr=ala0&tpl=5)  has 3,003 users following it and 12,071 posts. By comparison, the Chinese Tinder equivalent dating app Momo's [message board](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?ie=utf-8&kw=%E9%99%8C%E9%99%8C&red_tag=k3446766709) has 389,098 followers and 1,073,496 posts, or 129.56 times more followers and  89 times more posts. Momo's user count is [supposedly 100,000,000](http://www.cjxz.com/113398.html). Now most of those posts are thirsty thots trying to get laid so let's find another example. YY??, a twitch like broadcasting platform app, [supposedly 500,000,000 users.](http://www.cjxz.com/113398.html) Its [message board](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?ie=utf-8&kw=YY%E8%AF%AD%E9%9F%B3&fr=search) has 768422 followers and 23552499 posts. That's 255 times more followers and 1951 times more posts. Assuming there's a direct correlation between user count and message board post count/follower (there's really not), that would put Peiwo's user base between 256,278 - 1,960,754. If we do the calculation using Momo's 100,000,000 supposed user count, that puts Peiwo's range between 771,843 - 1,123,595 users.   
5. Peiwo is actually owned by Justin Sun, the guy who made Tron. According to The baidu wiki, it's parent company is [??????????????](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%94%90%E6%B3%A2%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%88%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%EF%BC%89%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8). and the CEO is ??? aka Justin Sun.

In conclusion: There's not a lot of data out there, draw your own god damn conclusions. My opinion is that while Peiwo may have 1 Million users, that's a drop in the bucket in the Chinese app market and doesn't mean jack shit. Am I still gonna hold on to my TRX? You bet your ass I am. 

Edit: Oh lookie what I've found, a god damn Chinese app ranking list: https://aso100.com/rank/monthly
Momo is at 75, YY is at 106, Peiwo is nowhere to be seen in the Top 500. Tsk tsk.     

Edit 2: Another ranking, posted in October, scroll halfway down to see the top 1000. : http://www.sohu.com/a/198836725_410407
Momo is at rank 48, YY is at 110, and Peiwo is nowhere in sight, not that anywhere I can see anyway. Friggin chart is in jpg, not searchable. But I skimmed through the 2 character apps in the Top 1000 and I don't see ??

Edit 3: Out of curiosity I tried to look for chinese crypto buyer's thoughts on TRON, found https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2333806.0;all. General consensus is that it's a trash coin with nothing backing it up. While it might go up in price, it won't last too long. "

> This is potentially a deterrent to new hosts and I'm not sure it is helpful for the renter.

It is actually intended to be a deterrent for new hosts.  The network will not benefit from hosts that are online *when they want to be*.  If a renter puts data on the network in 3x redundancy and 2 of them vanish due to churn or lack of interest, it is the renter that is penalized.   Without the commitment of collateral, it would be only the renter punished.  And that's bad user experience.

> My assumption is that the payment will be enough to keep hosts up for the most part

This is not entirely correct.  Being a host will not make you a millionaire.  So it is highly plausible for a large number of hosts come online and lose interest in the project within days, weeks or months.  For any number of reasons.

5710,1515154622.0,"Hi guys,

I've been getting into cryptos for the last 6 months and just wanted to share my thoughts on Dogecoin.

When I first started actually buying cryptos I started buying Bitcoin and Litecoin since they looked like safest bet. 

Now that I'm up on my investments and with the recent explosion of altcoins I'm looking to branch out.

My point though is that during this process I discovered DOGE. I've always known there was this thing called dogecoin, but I never learned anything about it since I started getting into cryptos. Doge seem is an OG of crypto but just hasnt seen much love recently.

So the things I liked about Dogecoin: - It is perhaps the most similar to bitcoin and litecoin. Doge has good activity community, one that appears to be more constructive than the Bitcoin community. As a form of payment and tipping in real transactions, dogecoins are the best fit. With the recent run up of atls like ripple, tron, cardano, etc. People will start looking at doge and doing the math and and wonder why such a long standing coin and supportive community has been overlooked. People will start to pour into Doge and really start to add value to this community.



TLDR: Dogecoin has been overlooked while Bitcoin and other alts have surged. Once people start looking deeper, they will start driving up the price of Doge

The problem that you already outlined is that the exchanges only show the price sold in Bitcoin (or whatever pair it is). 

Example:

* Event: I sold my coin for net proceeds 0.03 Bitcoin. 
* Problem: What exactly was the price of that coin in fiat (which the tax authority needs) at that very second when the transaction finished?
* Bigger problem: Now how do you cross reference the cost basis of the coin that was moved there from another exchange?

Will people really use bitcoin when it costs $100-$200 to send a transaction? I think we will reach that point in 2018.

Ann spent the last 6 years working and earning paychecks. She laughed off bitcoin as a ponzi scheme, a scam, a bubble, etc. She made fun of Bob and his 'fake internet money' any chance she could get. She never once considered researching the currency and the good it can have on the world. She decided it wasn't worth it to spend 30 minutes reading the 9-page whitepaper. She never put even a modest amount of money into it when it was worth pennies or dollars each, which would have net her the money Bob has. She also never put any money into it at $1500 (for example) which would have grown an order of magnitude by now. With each paycheck, she made the same decision to not buy bitcoin and instead buy pizzas or some shit with her disposable income. 

It goes the other way too. Bob mined in 2012. He rode it to dizzying highs multiplying his investment by 100 and yet decided not to sell. He decided not to sell at $10. He decided not to sell at $100 when he could buy a car with it. He decided not to sell at $1000 when he could buy a house with it. He decided not to sell during the long and seemingly endless down market. He decided not to sell at $10,000, etc. Remember that Ann could have bought in at any point.

1 - Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.

2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.

3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.

4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.

5 - Entries are important, but risk & money management is where you make or lose money.

6 - Beware of get-rich-quick gurus hopping on the crypto bandwagon over the past year.

7 - Decide which types of trade setups or investments you’ll take and ignore everything else.

8 - Don’t assume just because you’ve made a lot of money in crypto that you can just as easily make money in other financial markets. 95%+ of stock market traders LOSE money. The game is rigged. Stick to what you know works for you.

9 - The best way to day trade cryptocurrencies is – DON’T!

10 - The best way to profit in any market is to find something you think has big potential early (before the general public catches on), and invest assuming you’re going to lose 100% of your capital. It’s the “angel investor” approach.

11 - You can’t control the market. The only thing you can control is your entries, trade size, and exits.

12 - One market participant can completely destroy “good technical analysis”.

13 - Don’t blindly follow trade alerts from ANYONE, especially random people on social media or chat rooms.

14 - All financial networking marketing projects are ponzi schemes, period.

15 - If you make a life-changing amount of money, do NOTHING for at least 30 days.

16 - Trading isn’t about picking exact tops and bottoms in a market – it’s about catching the meat of a move.

17 - Don’t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.

18 - Don’t set daily profit target goals – set long-term performance goals.

19 - Learn to survive, then thrive.

20 - The best charting indicators are price action and volume. You can use others, but it won’t necessarily make you a more profitable trader.

21 - Trends can go way past what seems rational.

22 - Don’t try to pick tops in a market. Wait for the market to tell you when the trend is over.

23 - Don’t trade in front of big news events – it’s impossible to predict how markets will react.

24 - The biggest challenge for most traders is their ego, or the need to be right.

25 - You can lose 50% of your trades and still be profitable if you manage risk properly.

26 - The best entrepreneurs and CEO’s typically make the worst traders and investors.

27 - People with the best mindset for investing typically have a career in high-risk situations like firefighters, pilots, police.

28 - Avoid pump and dump groups like the plague they are.

29 - You WILL make every mistake in the book. Don’t beat yourself up when you make mistakes, just learn and try not to make the same mistake twice.

30 - Don’t treat crypto exchanges like bank accounts. You don’t own the coins unless you control the private keys.

31 - Crypto is a 24/7/365 market. You can’t catch every trade. If you miss one, don’t worry – there’s ALWAYS another trade.

32 - Don’t invest in a coin unless you understand it inside out.

33 - You can make money trading the momentum and hype in shitcoins, just don’t invest long-term.

34 - Stay away from coins with low trading volume and low market caps. They are easily manipulated and you can get stuck in a position.

35 - Don’t trade with money you need for living expenses. It’s called “risk capital” for a reason.

36 - Think of yourself as a hunter – save your ammo for the big game.

37 - Crypocurrency exchanges go down when there’s high volatility. If price hits a major target or buy zone, it might make sense to place some orders BEFORE everyone else.

38 - Trading and investing brings all your emotions to the forefront – fear, greed, hesitation.

39 - The hardest thing to do in trading is… NOTHING. This can also be the most profitable thing to do.

40 - Just because a market is in a “bubble” doesn’t mean it’s going to die. Bitcoin has been through over half a dozen big bubbles and increased in price after each one.

41 - Manage your trades in a way that would leave you with no regrets no matter what the market does.

42 - Learn to think like a contrarian. If you’re someone who needs to have your opinion validated by everyone around you, then trading and investing isn’t for you.

43 - The shorter the chart time frame, the less reliable the chart patterns are. The longer the time frame, the more variables affect price action and the harder it becomes to predict price. My sweet spot in the daily chart for trade setups and 60-minute chart for entries.

44 - Some market conditions are great for pushing the gas on every trade setup you can find, where other market conditions call for you to slam on the brakes and step away from the markets altogether.

45 - 90%+ of cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero. Invest accordingly.

46 - The mental side of trading is the hardest to master, the most under-appreciated skill, and will cause you to make or lose the biggest amounts of money.

47 - The 3 biggest problems for traders are over-trading, hesitating on entries, and closing positions prior to profit targets when the trade is still intact.

48 - You can make a career’s worth of profit in one year or one trade – don’t feel like every day has to be a home run. Play the long game. Be patient and wait for the best plays.

49 - Don’t trust anyone else to trade for you. Manage your own high-risk investments (like crypto trading) or don’t participate at all.

I understand the use case of the blockchain in the supply chain but what I dont understand is the use case and value of the coin. The containers im working with are using RFID chips that are connected with each sequentially over leaps using a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) because of the low range of the signal and efficient energy consume. The last one is connected with an edge router on the containership for example. This router is connected to the core network onshore. So this chain sensor --> supervisor works without any coins. What are they good for?

5990,1515157472.0,"Just remember: Do not let this guy off the hook just because he sold Mt. Gox before it tanked. He clearly knew of the security issues before he sold it to Mark Karpeles.

----From The Daily Beast----

When the prosecutors concluded their investigation into Karpeles in November, he was indicted for improper use of electronic funds and embezzling a total of over 300,000,000 yen ($2.7 million) of customer funds.

At this point in time, Karpeles’s lawyers would only say that Karpeles had made no confession to the police and that Karpeles is only guilty of sloppy accounting, mixing personal accounts and corporate accounts, not embezzlement.

Yet the documents obtained by The Daily Beast, which included correspondence between Mark Karpeles and the original founder of Mt. Gox, Jed McCaleb, suggest that Mt. Gox was plagued by problems from its earliest days, before Karpeles had even taken over the company. The Daily Beast was given internal documents including emails by a former consultant to Mt. Gox and then verified them with Karpeles’s lawyer, former employees, and sources in law enforcement.

Jed McCaleb first approached Mark about selling him Mt. Gox in January of 2011. In an email dated Jan. 18 that year, McCaleb wrote to his acquaintance Karpeles:

Hi Mark~

Please keep all this confidential I don’t want to start a panic and I’m not sure I’ll do it yet but I’m thinking I might try to sell mtgox. I just have these other projects I would like to devote more time to. Would you be interested? It could be very little up front and just a payout based on revenue or something. There is also an investment group that wants to fund mtgox. Probably around $158k. So you could most likely take it over with some cash.

Let me know

Thanks,

Jed.

Karpeles had become interested in Bitcoin in late 2010 and saw the Mt. Gox platform as the perfect place to set up a Bitcoin exchange. In the early days of the currency, changing fiat money (real money) into bitcoins was an arduous task.

Karpeles agreed to purchase the company from McCaleb and by Feb. 3, 2011, he had signed an agreement with McCaleb to buy the firm, under some very unusual terms.

The seller (McCaleb) wrote into the contract that “the Seller is uncertain if mt.gox.com is compliant or not with any applicable U.S. code or statute, or law of any country.” And it included an article of indemnification: “The buyer agrees to indemnify Seller against any legal action that is taken against Buyer or Seller with regards to mtgox.com or anything acquired under this agreement.”

Shortly after the handover, Karpeles became aware that Mt.Gox had already been hacked at least once and was missing a substantial number of bitcoins—a total of 80,000 to be precise.

The following email on April 28, 2011, which reportedly has been submitted into evidence by both sides in the trial, was probably the beginning of Mark Karpeles’s nightmare:

From: Jed McCaleb <jed@mtgox.com>

Date: 2011/04/28 22:33

To: Mark Karpeles <admin@mtgox.com>

I can’t tell how big an issue it will be to be short 80k BTC (*80,000 bitcoin) if the price goes to $100 or something. That is quite a bit to owe at that point but mtgox should have made a ton of BTC (Bitcoin) getting to there. There is also still the fact that the BTC (Bitcoin) balance will probably never fall below 80k. So maybe you don’t really need to worry about it.

There are 3 solutions I have thought of:

- Slowly buy more BTC with the USD that Gox Bot has. Hopefully you would fill up the loss before the price got out of hand.

- Buy a big chunk of BTC (really just moving the BTC debt to the USD side) If BTC goes up this is a huge win. Problem is there isn’t enough BTC for sale on mtgox. Maybe you could find someone on the forum to do it.

- Get those crystal island people to invest?They have 200+ BTC so they could fill in the gap.

Maybe you could just mine it?

The Daily Beast has been trying to reach Jed McCaleb for several weeks both through his email accounts and social media accounts but he has not responded.

Kim Nilsson, a computer security expert at WizSec who has been analyzing the case for over two years, says, “Assuming the emails are genuine considering the timing, both Mark and Jed were aware of some 80,000 BTC that seem to have already been missing before the large June 2011 hack, and Jed was suggesting possible approaches to recovering from it.” The question then remains: did either of them put these plans into action—for example creating a trading bot (a software application that runs automated tasks) to cover the loss.

That is still an unresolved mystery.

Try mining a coin with a lower difficulty if you are going to use your cell phone. I don't know where you got the idea that mining on your cell phone was a good idea. Do your research.

No bamboozle. I'm up to my neck in student loans, and this would pay off roughly 1/4th of my student debt (fucking interest and Sallie Mae.) So being able to pay off that much will help my life out so fucking much by freeing up enough debt to give me about an extra $400 a month.

EDIT: I just realized that $50k won't be that high after taxes when accounting for my income, so while I'll still stick to this pledge I'm a little down now thinking of how it won't make as big of a dent on my student loans as I thought it would. If I did the math right, then that $50k becomes roughly $40k (not including any fees exchanges will deduct.)

-Do you have to first create a wallet? Will that wallet give you your cypto public key and private keys? Do you have only one private key or do you get a new one each time you open up a new wallet (is this not recommended). How does the process work of just getting started with getting your BTC addresses and keys etc? I want to do that without buying anything. Just get my public/private keys set up on a wallet. Best wallets to recommend (I know trezor hardware is best but anything software for newbies)?


-What is the process like once you have your crypto or BTC addresses and keys? Can you then buy on an exchange and send your assets? Does an exchange give out publice or private keys? Clearly im confused on that process. 

-I see everyone out there trading alt coins right now printing money on DeepBrainChain, SALT, OMG and I want to start trading, but first need to acquire BTC safely and don't know the process to do it. Wish I had a friend to come over and help me get safely set up just one time!

6142,1515158786.0,"who cares?  right now we are in full blown shitcoin mania and eventually the musical chairs game will stop and everyone will be left holding bags of useless meme tokens while the smart people will have cashed out to fiat or a ""real"" crypto.  I don't think that many or most people are buying all these coins because they believe in the project or they even care, they are buying what they think will go 10x in 3 days and they are probably right.  Everyone is thinking everyone else is a fool who believes in whatever shitcoin du jour, but almost everyone is just buying a pump to dump it and move on to the next meme.

I don't care what the price of monero does, I have some so up would be welcomed but it doesnt mater that much.

What I am happy about is monero hasn't become a meme, the community isn't full of lambo talk and hype, the devs, community and image has retained its dignity in this landscape of shills, pumpers and con men.  Ultimately if the great people involved stay involved monero will become the #1 currency, maybe not in price but in utility.  At the end of the day none of this shit is worth anything it can't be used or no one is using it.  If you want monero to succeed keep using it, keep supporting the developers and researchers.  Let the shitcoin mania go on, hell I even trade some shitcoins here and there because I like to gamble and its fun.  But to me theres are 4 -5 real projects out there worth a damn and monero is at the top of that list.  "

6165,1515159100.0,"Great news, BUT Bitflyer in Japan already has litecoin. DMM won't make a dent in LTC or the others they are selling. Bitflyer is one of 11 government regulated exchanges in Japan. They already hold like 74% of the entire market volume. Coincheck hold about 24% (and also sells LTC but not in an exchange capacity, just ""sell"" and ""buy"" at REALLY bad spreads). Ziaf holds like 1% and the other 8 exchanges combined make up the remaining 1%. DMM is going to have a VERY hard uphill battle to get some of that volume their way. I am glad more people are entering the market. I want more alt coins in Japan and I want Ziaf to offer LTC too. But Coincheck and Bitflyer already both have very aggressive marketing underway in Japan. 

All I am saying IMO is that this won't make that much of difference in the short term for LTC. Japan is all about the BTC compared to Korea which is all about the ALTs. And a new exchange in Japan has long way to go to steal or help increase any volume.

6171,1515159153.0,"As a programmer who has recently entered this space, I have some doubts about your prediction on NEO - looking at their github yesterday there is very little meaningful code activity over these past few months.  Most of it is foreign language translations and when randomly clicking around the commit history a surprising amount of changes is the founder going in and re-naming a ton of variables which I am kind of wondering if it is just an effort to feign code activity.  Compare that to say XRB where those two guys are shitting out tons of meaningful changes every single day even on holidays.  Personally I think if that is any indicator, then NEO may be a doomed project unless there are more factors that I am not aware of.

? Proof of Stake

? SwiftX for sub-1 second transactions, which is a killer feature for Point of Sale

? Point of Sale app integrations in the works called Pivit

? Zerocoin privacy (the only coin to have implemented it on proof of stake)

? Incentivized nodes for scalability

?  1 minute blocktime with 2mb blocks.  

? Theoretical current maximum of 120 tx/s and our masternodes haven't even begun to adjust for scaling.  They can easily handle 20mb blocks for 10x that throughput.  Keep in mind Dash is aiming to use 400mb blocks, so there's a lot of runway to scale this way while other solutions are researched 

? Proven 76 tx/s already  

? Plenty of room in the blocks means exceptionally low fees (currently [$0.00107583](http://cryptoqe.com/))

? Proof of stake means you can earn 5 to 15% interest just for holding your coins

? Proof of stake means [ultra low inflation](https://i.imgur.com/LQSG84M.png) because there are no expensive miners to pay

? Perpetual coin emission means our rewards, which support a healthy network and coin, never run out

? Fees are burned, so there is no incentive for a fee market situation

? Burned fees also mean [deflation at a certain transaction volume](https://i.imgur.com/4Liz5Pc.png)

? Self-funded development, support, and marketing

? Mobile apps

? zDEX coming soon for no reliance on exchanges (another first in crypto)

At first when I doubled my $100 to $200 I cashed out my original investment and day traded with what coins I had.
Sold x amount of ""y""coin for ""e""coin and after a market move of ""y"" going down or ""e"" going up moved it back making myself more ""e""coin than I started with.

After I had made $500 doing that I felt comfortable investing more cash so I put in $1000. I did exactly the same thing and when my total was $6000 I cashed out my original $1000.

And now im really kicking ass imo. I have a ""bird dog"" amount that I move around. Back and forth to what ever is moving at the time. My goal is just to accrue more coins/tokens then I had at the start of trade.

Example I traded 2008 Power Ledger for 20914 (or so) Verge. Now that Power Ledger has weakened a little (and Verge has been very stable) I could trade it back right now and get 2355 Power Ledger thus increasing my PL stack by 347. Or I could trade 17830 Verge to recover my PL position and keep 3084 Verge for free. Win win.

Set yourself a goal and trade towards it.

I have a goal of once I hit $100,000 profit ill pull my ""bird dog"" out of the market and play with profits.

He never charged a penny and paid for material cost out of pocket every time (material cost is low even for high end stuff, glasses are pretty much paying for someone that knows what you're doing to make them correctly).

Anyway he was doing this outside of work on his own and the machine he used broke and unlike the materials that is NOT cheap and the old one can't be repaired because the company no longer services that model. New piece of equipment would cost around $10,000 but would allow him to make 100,000+ pairs of glasses (old one he bought used and had 250,000 cuts before it died) that's literally more than he'll ever make so he'd be set.

He always talked about how important he felt glasses were for kids paying attention and doing well in school and how often 'troubled kids' were messing around in class just because they couldnt see the board clearly and they didnt know it wasn't normal. Also unemployed people not being able to afford glasses, but then it would impact finding a new job.

Chinese Horoscope 2018 - Year of the Earth Dog 2018 horoscope, New Year 2018's horoscope and yearly predictions for the 12 Chinese zodiac signs

CHINESE NEW YEAR 2018 (CNY 2018) BEGINS ON FEBRUARY 16, 2018. IN 2018, THE 12 CHINESE ZODIAC SIGNS MUST SHOW TOLERANCE AND EMPATHY TOWARDS THE PEOPLE THEY MEET TO PRESERVE THEIR KARMIC BALANCE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY WISH TO AVOID UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS.
LOVE RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILY
In 2018, the meaning and importance of family are critical to the realization of the aspirations of all 12 of the Chinese zodiac signs. If you happen to be single during this yearly cycle, you shouldn’t have trouble finding a partner before the next Chinese New Year of 2019.


One must remember that the Chinese zodiac sign of the Dog, symbol of intelligence and protection, can also turn the year 2018 into a sensitive period, during which activists and students, but also ordinary citizens, feeling deprived of hope and socially excluded, won't hesitate to demand radical changes to their life conditions, and to preserve the future of their children.

It is often said that the Years of the Dog are carriers of violent conflict. Actually, only the Years of the Metal Dog can be related to warlike and destructive energies, because of their reinforced metal. The next planned year of the Metal Dog is in 2030.
Repeated once every 60 years in the Chinese calendar, the Year of the Earth Dog is a powerful marker in men and women's lives, offering when it occurs a new interpretation of our human condition. Strength of character, education, morality, social life, health and caring for our elders are all fundamental questions which should be revised and improved during this pivotal period. The emergence of new authors and philosophers, as much as the reissue of forgotten texts by great classical writers and poets, should wake up and feed this collective awareness.

We can also expect to witness the birth of new ambitious industrial projects, completely remodeling the modes of production and exploitation of energy resources, particularly in the field of solar energy, which now matured enough to become one of the main cheap sources of electricity both in transportation and at home. All initiatives showing their contribution to reducing pollution and improving the quality of life are encouraged and funded by most states, major industrial and financial institutions worldwide.

Actions based solely on individual drive and demagogy are unmasked and rejected by the majority, giving way during this period to the more universal values of empathy and social justice.

The Earth element in its Yang form, associated with the Chinese zodiac sign of the Dog, just as a mountain watching over humans living on the edge of her dress of stone, vibrates from inside with the tremor of truth and justice, even for those of us who don’t want to hear it."

Maxthon browser (yes yes there are a lot of people in this Earth that don't swear loyalty towards Firefox and Chrome... if you don't aware about it yet), has team up with certain company to offer browser mining capability. From far as my stupid brain's understanding, you basically just use the browser, and you get rewarded for that company's crypto currency.

What if you just use browser and get Dogecoin as reward overtime? This can be implemented via the browser mining method these days that replacing ads, if you can pursue some popular websites with decent traffic to implement one. You visit their sites and in return you get Doge...

Or you can do that for this subreddit as well... 

But what's the different of browser mining? Why don't people just mine with regular miners? Workload. Browser mining don't necessarily consume all the computing power. When I doing my work or playing games, obviously I don't want to have a miner running, but running a browser is fine. "

6454,1515161947.0,"Have some dogecoin locked in a wallet that you forgot the password too? 

I do.

Reddit is surprisingly lacking in an answer to this question. So I did some research and found a way.

It is called btcrecover. It is free and open source. Find the github here: https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover?files=1

It takes a little bit of knowledge to setup and operate but it is not too difficult. The tutorial is easy to follow. I was able to get it operational in about 45 minutes.

The caveat here is that it does not ""find"" the password for the wallet from nothing. You have to input what password(s) you think it is and it will try millions of different iterations to help determine the correct phrase from the inputs.

Now, I am still working on my wallet password. It has tried a million + passwords so far. The longest estimated run was about 1 billion potential passwords. (This would have taken 1.5 years to try each combination). 

If anyone is successful at recovering their password, please let me know.

6621,1515162958.0,"There are some issues with just picking a new decimal place and making it standard:

1. Bitcoin will shift in value a lot, so trying to choose one decimal place as being the point to orient around can easily have the same problem at a later time.

2. Different countries for a long time will have different values for similar items, so what might be a 0.1 ""Bit"" purchase in one part of the world could be a .001 ""Bit"" purchase elsewhere, so the decimal problem doesn't really go away for everyone evenly.

3. Different cultures view money differently. In the US, they think of money in decimalized units, where a sandwich might be ""three dollars and fifty cents"", but in Japan, they prefer no decimals, so a sandwich would be ""three hundred and fifty yen"". I'm sure people around the world deal in all scales of money with different conventions, so we need something a little more flexible.

6706,1515163461.0,"Yes, there is a good possibility of this but let's not fall prey to the kind of echo-chamber kind of mindset that typifies some of the less reputable coins and tokens out there.

I certainly expect a lot of the steam to come off Ripple in the next few weeks as traders seek to lock in gains by diversifying their portfolios. We have more recently seen a number of very solid smaller coins drastically jump in value so I wouldn't be surprised to see a good portion of the gains to flow into them, in the hope that they will see further compounding gains.

I firmly believe that Ether is going to be looking forward to dramatic growth coming up in 2018. But we also need to keep cool heads about ourselves as well, it's OK to get excited but don't fall into the trap of believing all the hype out there. Personally I would take slow and steady growth of ETH over unpredictable surges and drops - and so would the financial industry in general.

When I first started investing in stocks, I'd buy stocks with fundamental value in excess of their price. Even if they'd gone bankrupt, selling off their assets would net me more than I paid for the stock!

Meanwhile, ""the market"" was chasing technical analysis and hype. I watched clearly inferior firms' stocks soar, while my diamond in the rough languished.

Eventually (after about 18 months), I realized I didn't have whatever it took for trading, and I became a mutual fund investor--I started holding by sector for the long term and stopped following individual stocks. After about another 2-3 years, the stock I'd bet on suddenly jumped 1,000% or so.

I'm not a pumper in the pump-and-dump racket, I'm likely to be the guy left holding the bag, so I'm looking for coins with some fundamental value (such as XMR) and just buying and holding. I look for standouts, coins with something different to offer. I missed out on XRP (and will continue to miss out if it keeps rising) but I'm okay with that, because with what I know it'll peak the moment I buy some."

* You can use a hardware wallet just fine through Parity, and use the Parity-Chrome integration until it supports hardware wallets natively.

* You don't actually need any ZRX token, as they're not charging fees during the beta (although I did need to authorize their contract to use my (non-existent) ZRX).

* You have to do the whole thing where you 'wrap' your ETH as WETH to use it, but the [contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2956356cd2a2bf3202f771f50d3d14a367b48070?) seems to be well understood enough and ~~not tied to Radar Relay~~ is shared across 0x Protocol.

People complain about Justin and his marketing, also marketing presented in whitepaper. I picked it up because marketing was one of the things that I liked. Also in my opinion Justing has something to prove with his biggest project to date and his reputation to be front runner of new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs. He is young, but what's the problem? Mark Zuckerberg was also at the beginnings of facebook. Look what Elon Musk is doing with his projects if not hyping them up?

I like that hype around him is being leveraged to get his foot in the door when trying to sell product. My personal view is that most people on this subreddit are fancy about tech but not selling. Coins are popping up like mushrooms, everyone is groundbracking but how you actually adopt and sell it?


One more thing that people have problem with is that founders are incentivized because they own coins. I am totally fine with it. I prefer that people make money if project is successful, we are in one boat. I would rather have that than ""it's all for free, groundbreaking, fast and decentralized"". As much as I believe in tech I believe also in human nature. And people want to make money. You don't go to work just for fun, cool project is not enough to buy your time. That's my opinion. 


Project is big and roadmap is stretched, that is my concern. That's why TRX has the higghest risk in my portfolio and I play it long term. Anyway, I am sticking to my guns and we will see how this plays out later."

7020,1515164443.0,"IMO Decred doesn't really have a better word than ""atoms"" to specify units of itself:

1. Other cryptocurrencies are beginning to crowd the ""credits"" namespace (see: [a](https://credits.com/), [b](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verify/))
2. If you don't say atoms or credits to describe the DCR unit of account, you'd have to say ""how much decred is that?"" or ""how many dbits do you want?""
3. As a would-be investor in Decred, if $10 in DCR buys you 10,000,000 atoms or 0.1 DCR, your preference is likely to get the 10M atoms, because it feels like you're getting more for your money.

Saying ""how much decred do I owe you?"" or ""how many dbits is that?"" doesn't quite roll off the tongue the way ""how many atoms?"" does. And there are [good reasons](https://mobile.twitter.com/BitcoinCashFund/status/949004102696161284/photo/1) to prefer giving investors larger numbers of the underlying asset per dollar invested.

7022,1515164467.0,"Put it simply, majority of the cryptocurrencies are going to fall. If you have picked a winning horse, you will be able to use that coin for what it was designed for.

For example: If Amazon takes on XRP (Ripple), people who own XRP can purchase things from Amazon. No need to worry about price differences between countries and you know it is secure as Amazon wouldn’t want something that is unreliable.

Another example:  if RDD (Reddcoin) goes in the direction it is aiming for, rather than supporting social media creators through patreon or PayPal, you can send/tip them RDD.  

The main positive is the transaction times with the newer crypto coins, send someone across the world money within 5 minutes and knowing it is safe.

7051,1515164592.0,"Whomever made this video completely misunderstands the concept of ripple and xrp. The concept has always been a 1 for 1 amount trade for dollar not Bitcoin . Think of it as viewed from the dollar side entering the crypto world. When ripple was made Bitcoin was mined and going for $70 bucks. XRP wanted to be the safe portion to send and receive BTC between banks. At that time there was only Bitcoin and Litecoin. Ripple/XRP is old... been around longer then other coins.
 
The video is right on two parts which is liquidity and Banks. When investment banks such as JPmorgan started bonding BTC they needed a way to securely move into the crypto currency world and the SEC banned them from certain trading parts of because of the BTC. Now investing houses can reach into crypto with a safety net. If JPmorgan or any other investment group need liquidity it will come from the amount locked up, and when you need to move multiple transactions you will need that liquidity. Right now you are doing one token/coin a transaction... investors need multiple options per token/investor. You want that USD $20,000 value BTC but how are you going to keep that value unless there is a easy way for investors to get in like xrp? see you don't get it.

Premined, when ripple was first created it followed a trend as other ICO at that time of being premined there were several coming out at 2012 that were premined and ripple/xrp has seemed to last.

If you take a step back and see that the investors and founders of ripple have even stated that BTC is like gold and is like the ultimate scale in crypto world then you can understand that they just want xrp/ripple to be another player on the field and not a one stop solution, they pretty much say that. They are both invested in Bitcoin and XRP personally. They want xrp and ripple to be liquidity to move other crypto. When it is time for you to cash our on another coin and by that lambo they want to be the middle man to quickly offer banks a solution to handle your crypto problem.

Oh the reason for the wallet activation is to prevent bots, people from manipulating the market. You would have to invest so much to open multiple wallets to try to manipulating the xrp blockchain.

As far as Chuck e cheese token, being a long time miner around 2010 I remember the News calling bitcoin chuck e cheese tokens... oh the irony. Bitcoin miners always disliked xrp as it was fundamentally different and nobody understood why. lucky I was gifted with thousands myself as will as mining my own bitcoin. I see a equal playing field, not a scam and not something that will threaten the crypto world.  Chillax bro.

I also hold a similar portfolio to most people here. I have ETH, LTC, VEN, REQ, IOTA, ICX, and XLM. I had XVG but sold to get more into XLM. My smallest holding by far is REQ. I have 3 questions.
1. Should I sell TRX?, I have heard a lot of bad comments and how it could be a huge scam.
2. What about Ripple? It was the first coin I bought and makes up around 50% of my portfolio. If so where should the gains go? I have heard VEN XLM ICX and REQ are set to have a big 2018.
3. What about my LTC? hodl? Or invest somewhere else?

> Do you have to first create a wallet? 

Yes

> Will that wallet give you your cypto public key and private keys? 

Yes

> Do you have only one private key or do you get a new one each time you open up a new wallet (is this not recommended). 

Most people use BIP39 wallets which use a 12 to 24 word sentance of random words that are used to create all the public / private keys you will ever need.

> How does the process work of just getting started with getting your BTC addresses and keys etc? I want to do that without buying anything.

I recommend Coinomi (android) or Jaxx (ios), but there are many many others... those are just the ones I know.

> Can you then buy on an exchange and send your assets? 

Yes, it will cost money to move assets anywhere from $15 down to pennies, or sometimes free.  Varies wildly, most people never estimate this stuff and burn tons
 
> Does an exchange give out publice or private keys?

Never... only the recieve address, which is technically nether type of key

> don't know the process to do it.

1. Open a coinbase account (see PM), or google it.
2. Scan your driver's license (must be 18 and in the US)
3. Log into GDAX (it's actually a coinbase site)
3. Buy BTC / LTC / ETH
4. Open a binance account (see PM), or google it.
5. Find your binance ""deposit"" address.
6. On GDAX, select withdraw to address, enter your Binance address.
7. Wait an hour, or a day.
8. Your BTC / LTC / ETH should arrive on binance and you can now buy SuperCoin or WhataCoin or whatever."

Some cards do a decent job of being a display card while you mine at the same time. Vega doesn't do this well. I have two different PC's with Vega 64 cards mining. For both of these I am using another card for the display. For example, I have one PC with a Fury Nitro and Vega 64 mining. The display is connected to the Nitro. Both cards are mining, no artifacts. I recommend always putting your non-vega card in the first PCI-E slot nearest your CPU. For some reason, positioning these in a different configuration causes Windows to hang on startup if your monitor is connected to the non-vega card when using the blockchain drivers. It's all a buggy mess, but when it works it works incredibly well. I get 2900h/s from these two cards alone. Taking the CPU into account, a Ryzen 1700, this PC is a 3400h/s mini-rig. "

7225,1515165736.0,"(Background- I have been a sous chef for years. Never had more than 5k in my bank account and work 12 hour days regularly. )

Last year I bought 144 Eth at the going price of around $10. My goal was to buy a van and travel the country with my girlfriend, so when Eth skyrocketed to $17 I sold and bought a 97 Dodge Van.

I spent all summer converting the van to a camper and saving my pennies. The van is now done and we are about to take off. Can you believe my surprise when out of curiosity I checked the price of Eth? My cheap old van now cost me somewhere around $100k!

For a while, I was bitter. I looked with disdain at my new house on wheels, thinking about the life-changing amount of money it cost me.

Then, I remembered it was Eth that quickly got me the savings I needed. It was Eth that bought me a van I my partner and I will make memories in forever.

So if you sold early, or missed a dip or bought high, remember that there will always be opportunities you will miss and money you could have made, but be grateful for the things in your life that aren't about money. Think about the ways you can change and change others lives around you if you held. Take a breather from the screen."

$GTC. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/game/ (Just added to CMC 2 days ago) Current Price ~$0.20 Coins in circulation ~960M ( Market cap is $192M for a WORKING product.

Exchange: gate.io

I think this is a moonshot.

This coin is the currency for the game.com platform. As some of you may know, this is the platform that the crazy popular TRX Pet Planet is launched on (http://tron.game.com/) https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/948527252584595456

In the game, they distribute GTC tokens out to people who buy the dogs as a ""rebate."" In the game, they peg 1 GTC = 5 TRX. Given TRX's price at $0.25, 1 GTC should then by ~ $1.25. Gate.io is selling it for only $0.20. Given that the tech is proven and is already handling insane volume right now by Chinese buyers, there is a huge amount of growth potential for this coin!

Pros: Working platform and product, working partnership with TRON, low market cap, get in early

Cons: No dev team presence on social media, unclear if able to deposit outside GTC into tron dogs game"

But at the end cryptos have helped me accumulate a nice bit of ""savings"" so I want to focus more on the ideological aspect of it and get more people to adopt it - and that in a healthy manner, not losing hard earned money in a scam Ico. I also started up a website of my own to offer help to individuals and institutions alike. I would love your feedback on it as well. But I'm not sure if we are allowed to post website links so I will not do that for now, and wait for mods to opine. As part of the probono offer, I will give first 10 people to DM me, a 1 hour session of free consulting (Skype). We can talk about anything, simpler things like how block chain works, what are altcoins, my favs, trading vs mining, what the hell cryptokitties are, how to scan for ?COs or if you are a company, how you can leverage the new tech to be more competitive, how you can use smart contracts or create your own block chain."

They’re currently one of the biggest energy companies in Romania and already have a working product(contrary to projects like POWR), and pulled in $20,000,000 in revenues in 2017. By 2019 they’re looking to globalize their services to North America & Europe, essentially providing cheap power to the consumer.

I guess maybe I could represent the average person who is not ignorant by any means yet this is just not my thing. My formal training is elsewhere. But I do know business, and although there is no substitute for highest quality best construction design Etc of something.... when it comes down to it the average person needs to be pandered to if it is to be something that is accepted, used, and trusted by the masses that has staying power... I have enough sense to know when I'm in something above my paygrade to ask somebody that I trust that knows what they're talking about and I'm told XMR is something different something better and has high quality technology and intelligent people behind it. But I can tell you right now it is way too complicated to figure out how to buy it use it store it mine it Etc for the average person there's just too steep of a learning curve for most people to mess with and if it's not made more user-friendly etc then it won't matter at all how beautiful/ technically Superior/ whatever it Maybe... Because much like how musicians usually don't listen to music played on the radio yet if they don't acknowledge why that is they will never become a household name.... which is okay for a lot of them but for those trying to become a huge success it's not that they should compromise their integrity but if they don't Pander to the masses they had better be something truly special or nobody will ever give a damn.... And don't assume just because people don't speak or understand technical jargon or because they may not have the expertise in this Arena that they are ignorant or that they don't hold the future of this in their hands.

The information is not relevant to the blockchain and would be inefficient use of the technology. A powerful party can always overrule the consensus with force.

July 16 2007 was the trigger event that created the chain reaction that was to lead the 2008 financial meltdown. That's when 2 hedge funds sponsored  by Bear Sterns, specializing in leveraged casino bets on debt deviratives collapsed into insolvency. .. 

the canary gasps for breath in the stifling swamp of global banking.... 

meanwhile as the bankers totter forward , two well-funded trojan horse operatives  have postioned themselves to gain commit access:  Pieter [?] W in jan-2011 and and Greg ? in feb-2012. That gives them several more years to stretch their street-cred before they need to wield their ""veto"" votes in order to neutralize the votes of Gavin A for alpha and Jeff G for gamma that threaten to subvert 2 of the most critical fixed variables : the incumbent blocksize and the consensus-veto protocol that had been consolidated under the tutelage of our 2 blockstream loyalists Greg and Pieter ably supported by their boss Adam B for beta. 

the greek ? = beta is used typically in regression analysis to help us understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (fees e.g.}  changes when some of the independent variables ( block weight e.g.) are varied, while the most critical variables ( narrative, blksize and consensus-veto  protocol e.g.) are held fixed.

the greek ? = gamma for Garzik is the symbolic camel bending down to enter the archway with a height of 2 meg, when the push comes to the shove as happened in oct-2017. Then in early nov-2017, the archway of 2 meg proved too difficult and dangerous to negotiate even with the maximum bend possible so that all attempts to enter had to be abandoned.... 

the greek ? = pi for Piieter, denotes mastery of circuituous  logic which gives a semblance of certainty [314]

the greek ? = mu for Maxwell G, denotes the micro measurement that would stand 100 times bigger than the humble sat.

fast forward to 2017...After an exhausting and exhaustive critique of the ecosystem, a critical mass of early adopters waken up and start plotting  en masse a la fork and so on the first of august 2017 they manage to deliver their coup de grâce to the not so well-behaved singularity that was once monolithic bitcoin.

7432,1515167398.0,"Hi all, I thought I would jump into this daily discussion thread and give a bit of a stream of thought and an update on ARK and where I think we are headed.

We don't need to rely solely on the ark team nor public relations to succeed. We will succeed no matter what and I'll tell you why. First, the group of community developers we have is excellent.  Many of the developments that users of ARK enjoy were built for and by the community. This includes true-block-weight voting to eliminate pool hoppers, Noah to keep delegate nodes efficiency improve, development kits and hackathons have been developed and organized by the community. We have a long list of passionate community members and these types continue working and improving ARK without permission. Many of the official ARK crew started as community developers. The ARK team supports its community. 

But we can still do more as a community to help the ARK team support us. The ARK community needs a platform for members of the community to receive funding/support for their efforts, as well as a place to put forth ideas you want to see get done and provide funding. That is why we're building a funding website, not unlike kickstarter or bounty0x, for members of the community to put themselves out there and be funded for helping ARK succeed. A decentralized place for the community to fund projects, people, and ideas will help guide ARK in the best direction. This will prove to be one of ARK's most important projects. 

Secondly, I thought I would give you all a bit of an update on the ACES project. I will be releasing more in depth blog posts on this topic in the near future but wanted to give you all some insight on how we've progressed. ACES is going to be extremely important to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. ACES will serve as the backbone for what many businesses and individuals require to operate blockchain businesses and services. 

1) We are introducing service channels. Service channels are opened by the consumer and remain open indefinitely as long as the consumer and the service provider keep them open. This means setting up a service channel for continuous transfers from coin X to ARK is possible without resubmitting any contracts. 

2) We have developed a protocol which will allow for the linking of services. This means that two independently operated services can be connected by the consumer to form a multi-step service that executes in one step. So now you utilize a service BTC to ARK, but use the service address of a separate ARK to ETH service to create a BTC to ETH service channel that is opened indefinitely. This can function much like the lightning network. This also means that any external team only needs to create an X to ARK service in order to add the entire ACES ecosystem of services to their community. They will all do this because it is extremely easy to do so, and because the community members will do it for them for free. 

3) AIP 11, for those unfamiliar, will introduce multisig and time lock. Two features used by [atomic swaps](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading). This means that when ARK 2.0 is released, we will be able to build atomic-swap like services into the ACES ecosystem.  So now we have lightning network function, and atomic-swap services. 

4) All of these features are highly technical, and very difficult to use by consumers, and that is why businesses and individuals will be using ACES for these services. We will give consumers and developers a protocol for listing, finding, and consuming all of these services, and you all know it will look great because we've seen the designs the ARK team has done.

7474,1515167807.0,"Not everyone panic sells.

I would like to share my perspective, I sold only 33% at 2200 after it rose 1200% in the last 30 days especially because others will panic sell. Coincidence: people misinterpreting the Coinbase statement that no decision has been made triggered a panic sell.

I really do not care about coinbase but there have been just too many posts about it. People now seem relate the value of XRP to a coinbase listing which is bull.
Personally I think we should stay away from this exchange as I start to lose trust in CB.

XRP has been my first crypto, I love it and see a great future but lets not kid ourselves, what goes up so fast will always retrace. (see BTC December)
Also, due to the massive rise, XRP rose to become 55% of the portfolio which makes it a risk to the overall value in case of others indeed panic sell. 

I really hope that it will only continue to rise to around 120$ but I do not think that is realistic so I consider it best to take a bit of profit and see what happens.
If it continues to rise, great I try and buy a dip which will give me less xrp than what I had but this means I did not lose money, I only missed out on potential additional gains. 
If XRP corrects, same thing inversely, I end up with additional XRP.

For those reading this, be careful trading, you are better of HODLing most of the time.

7490,1515167919.0,"My background is that I worked at large hedge funds for a long time, specializing in technology stocks. So my experiences have given me a good framework to use on analyzing crypto from a fundamental perspective. I left because I wanted more personal flexibility. Now I do whatever I want, whenever I want.

I am mostly invested in ETH and have started building a position in OMG. Have a few things to say.

One, the quality of the discourse here is much better than most altcoin subreddits. There is real analysis here. While some of the numbers you guys are throwing out there on staking rewards feel aggressive, no other altcoin even has that kind of analysis being done. I applaud you guys on doing that kind of math because it is similar to the analysis we would perform on stocks.

Two, we are in silly season. Things are going up for no reason. Connecting this with my first point, most of you sound pretty intelligent. You are actually looking at the fundamentals. The issue right now, many of the incremental buyers are looking at the one liner ""hype story"" and buying indiscriminately. Ironically, OMG's story doesn't sound as sexy, because it has more of a real life business case. Some of the hype stories out there sound much more juicy. ""Buy this, it's the next bitcoin"". You can't say that about OMG. I also think that OMG's regional focus on Southeast Asia hurts it. From a seasoned investor's POV, it's a positive to attack a regional market that has high demand for the specific product, but from a newbie's POV, they may think of it as being too narrow. This same effect happens in stocks, where the more intellectual bull cases take time to get understood by the market.

Third, when the pain comes in some of these altcoins, it will be brutal. Many of them have zero reason to exist. I'll keep it at that. ETH has a reason to exist. So does OMG.

Fourth, the trading action in OMG reminds me of ETH. Long consolidations and quick rips. I haven't figured out why this is the case. It feels like there might be large holders who are slowly liquidating (ETH trades like this because of ICOs converting to fiat). If any of you have data backing this up or a view on this, I'm all ears. Because of this trading action, it rewards patience, because if you miss the quick rips, you've missed the whole move.

Eventually people will see what this is worth. Happy HODLing."

7528,1515168202.0,"If you're like me, you probably feel confused that Monero is #14 and that it is seemingly losing out to premine, shit coin vaporware that even if they were what they claimed would have minimal utility due to the fundemental value proposition of a blockchain and their non-private, non-fungible nature. 

I think the reason is this: we're obviously in a bubble of some sort, and the market is extremely irrational. At some point, the market will become more rational, or the bubble will pop. Coins with strong fundementals will last, and the others will fade. 

Here is why 2018 is going to be huge for Monero:

1. Hardware wallets are coming; it will be easer to use.

2. It is getting packaged for Debian, and that means we'll likely get the Monero GUI in TAILS. It will be easier to install, and easier for DNM users to use - this, along with points 3 and 4 will ensure that Monero absolutely dominates the DNM, and related businesses. https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/2395

3. Multisig, subaddresses, and bulletproofs will improve trustlessness, improve privacy, and improve scalability respectively. 

4. An open source monero-only silkroad marketplace is actively being buil and will use multisig transactions https://github.com/annularis/shop



It sucks that it is losing ground in marketcap percentage, but I think it is fine that it doesn't during mania: it generally increases in marketcap as a percentage when the market is crashing, which IMO is a much better sign of the health and utility of Monero. "

7569,1515168530.0,"Hey I know I'm just some guy on Reddit, but the more I read about XRB, the more I'm convinced it could really do what Bitcoin tried to do. I think you should stay excited about it and keep chasing that curiosity that drove you to buy some. I'd hate for Bitcoin to have turned you off the space altogether.

It sucks to move bitcoin around right now. It sucks to do anything with it other than hold it right now.

I went through the exact same thing as you when I started, paying a ton just to move it around.

I don't know what the sentiment is in this subreddit, but in pretty much any subreddit other than r/Bitcoin, people are increasingly seeing Bitcoin as ""the MS DOS"" or ""the AOL"" or ""the MySpace"" of crypto. It's a huge breakthrough and it has a first mover advantage, but it might not be the one that sticks around for decades and reaches billions of users.

I would suggest you take your experience as a learning experience (which it sounds like you've already done) and instead of transfering bitcoin to buy XRB or other alts with, try transferring Litecoin or Ether.

Let me know if you have any questions :)"

As former holder and firm believer in your tech and the usefulness of this network, I hope that your project will be the one to take the #1 spot on CMC if it's not ""us"".

I've seen a lot of resentment from both camps, but I truly believe that all digital currencies are in this race together to change the world as we know it. I think strong currencies like ours can make the pie bigger for all digitial assets and grow awareness. So let me just say, that I'm genuinely cheering you on in your race to the top! Cheers guys"

7584,1515168668.0,"You're right in some cases. The riser can provide 75W, though the actual draw can be less depending on the card. A card pulling 250W would not be safe with a splitter, as it would need at least 175W from the PCIe connection, which would be safe only up to 150W. That being said, many cards use less wattage by default, and can be undervolted to use even less. I have some 1060s that use only 80W, which means that they're safe to use with a splitter (the riser would need to provide only 5W)."

I'll be honest.... it was one of those late nights staring at the monitors.... I was saying to myself... the worst that happens is it crashes and I hate myself deeply for buying when I do. But you know what? I stopped myself. Because yall wise people say be wise... index funds...don't put in what you can't afford to lose. And ofc you are right. I mean only an idiot would do that right? Yet I've come to accept that I am the village idiot... I might not be able to time the market, I might only own 5 Ether, but I'm proud of that, I've been DCA at random intervals since 420 price and I'm proud because I believe in the technology. If it all fails tomorrow and I walk away with nothing so be it. I don't believe in my fiat on its own, but I do believe in the change it can cause by putting it into Ethereum. Insult me, break me, ignore me, whatever have you. I will HODL without regrets because I am an idiot, and I am okay with that.""

7723,1515169869.0,"I have been lurking around the crypto community for a while, but I wanted to encourage people to think of their coin portfolios the same as their stock portfolios... meaning think in terms of risk! Coin trading seems to be where the stock market was 50 years ago. There is a lot to learn from some of the institutions to investing. For coins, I would characterize risk in terms of how long it has been trading, if there is a true use-case, and are there any shortcomings within the coin. To break it down a bit:

Low Risk (Low Reward) - These coins probably won't plummet anytime soon, but they aren't going to go crazy either. In the stock market these would be your blue chip stocks (think Ford or Walmart) in coin terms I think it would be BTC, maybe ETH (but that is almost in a low-moderate risk category).

Moderate Risk / Moderate Reward - These coins are relatively well established. They have some track history, but could go higher. This could also hold some of the up and coming coins, depending on where they are in the cycle. They could become established or they could be just the ""coin of the week.""

High Risk / High Reward - This is where the real shit coins come in. You could make bank, but there is a significantly higher likelihood you will lose it all. Shilling coins is great (but really, shut up already), but the sheer fact that someone is shilling a coin (and the fact that a crowd mentality follows) tends to make me put a coin in the high-risk category.

A good portfolio has a mix of the above. The exact mix is dependent on the willingness you are to lose your coins. Personally, I have a 50/40/10 portfolio.

Anyways, what do you guys consider in each category? I think this would also be a much more useful metric to newbies than general coin comparisons or shilling.

That is probably why the transaction fee is so high.

The size of a transaction (and thus its cost) is determined mostly by the number of ""inputs"". Every time you receive bitcoins, if you want to send those bitcoins, it is another input.

For example, if your wallet receives 1 BTC in one transaction, then sending that 1 BTC will require 1 input. On the other hand, if you received the 1 BTC in 100 separate transactions, then sending that 1 BTC will require 100 inputs.

I thought I could do this by passing in an array of structs and just iterating over it but the remix IDE is giving me errors. Googling hasn't helped and since one of the errors appears to be a bug in the compiler's error reporting, I thought I'd ask the community.

My struct:
```
    struct MyStruct  {
        uint8 a;
        uint8 b;
        uint8 c;
    }
```

I've tried using `external` and I've tried using `public` (with `memory`) but each gives a different error. The most informative error is from this:

```
    function setAlphabet(MyStruct[] snakes) external {
```
since the error actually has a description:
```
InternalCompilerError: Illegal data location for struct.
```

I figured this was because I was trying to store the structs as calldata (whatever that is) so I switched to memory:

```
    function setAlphabet(MyStruct[] memory snakes) public {
```

but it gives a less informative error, indicating at least some level of bug in the compiler that remix uses:

```
InternalCompilerError: 
```
(it's missing the error description)

That means we are nearing a break out.  It doesn't have to be up or down technically.

7818,1515170591.0,"Hey guys. Long time lurker and have loved all the info this giving community has provided. 

So far I have only been active on the trading side of the crytpo-space, but want to jump into the mining side to broaden my understanding and horizons.

The parts stores in my area have been running out of stock (fully sold out of 570/580, no 1070 or 1070ti < $500USD). I happened to drop by the parts store when they had a shipment come in at the very end of the day, and they told me they wouldn't be updating the inventory until the next day.

So there are 32 MSI 1070ti Titanium cards coming in, and they will be priced at $525USD. There aren't many other options, I had tried to buy 8x of the EVGA 1070ti FTW2 but the sales associate apparently 'misplaced' my hold and they were sold to someone else in the 40mins it took for me to drive there (... right...).

Anyway... I guess my question is: I am hearing talk that there will be price bumps coming up for numerous cards on both the ATI and nVidia side, and while I know that this isn't a great price on a 1070ti card, it may be my only shot to get a good foothold in the space.

What would you guys do in my situation? Show up when the store opens tomorrow and buy them all and make 4x8GPU rigs? The parts store have the rest of the parts to complete the rig, including 8GPU frames.

Would really like to get some insight... would prefer not to go through all the trouble of buying the gear if I would be better off waiting for a better or cheaper card to become available!

Justin is a very clever individual, he is great at promoting TRON on social media. Use of those words are for marketing purposes, it attracts people's attention. How can you hate on that? Do you want every Justin to be like the Justin of VERGE?

(2) The recent partnership with game.com:

How many gaming platforms out there that uses the blockchain technology? Do you see Tron dog just as a game? Tron dog will get people to actively trade Tron tokens for a purpose and increase its circulating value. I bet you haven't actually play the game. As a store owner i can tell you the game is there for people to MAKE MONEY. If you are a store owner like me, 20k Tron start up store is granting me 1000+ Tron NET PROFIT a day with no global audiences yet. Plus once you don't want to sell dogs anymore, the platform will take back the store you bought for 20k Tron. For buyers, you pay 200Tron for a dog, see it as a store of value, not only that, you get a random amount of G token with every dog you purchase. Usually people purchase from me gets back 80-90% of their 200Tron back through G Token. You can cash out your Tron ANYTIME once they implement the function later on. This 'Game' helps promote Tron and is literally free money to everyone who participates.

The Bitcoin market is looking quite solid lately and pushing against the previous resistance we saw around 15400 – 15600.

We can see that the market has been moving up slowly since we found support at 12k usd on the 30th of December last year.

In my opinion we will test the resistance at 15600 should the momentum keep going in the favour of the Bulls and maybe as high as 15700, however there is still a lot of selling pressure and if the trading volume does not increase I expect that we might test 15k and revisit the 14k zone before we push higher again.

Short term support for me is at 12k – 14k and resistance is between 15k – 16k, with a break above 16k the most likely to summon us some fomo’ers back into the market.

People pump and dump things all the time , just look at the top exchanges to find out the pattern: the cheapest coins (in terms of price , not mkt cal)  are systematically being pumped in the hopes that their cheap price makes them attractive to naive investors.

What we are experiencing is a hallucination induced by irrational exuberance over the future prospects of digital money.

A Nocoiner is a person who has no Bitcoin. Nocoiners (usually Socialists, Lawyers or MBA Economists ) are people who missed their opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price because they thought it was a scam, and who is now bitter at having missed out. The nocoiner takes out his or her bitterness on Bitcoin Hodlers, by constantly claiming that Bitcoin will crash, is a scam, is a bubble, or other types of easily refuted FUD. Nocoiners have little to no computer skills or imagination; even when they see the price of Bitcoin go up and its adoption spread they consider all Bitcoin users to be in a collective delusion, with only themselves as the ones who can see what is happening. This attitude comes from being steeped in the elitist priest cultures found at Harvard, Yale and Columbia, where anyone who is not part of their clique is treated with suspicion by default.

7917,1515171511.0,"Hello Moonboys,

So, in the last tech rant I got feedback that it would be better to focus on some more markets-oriented topics. Hence, I decided to make a tech rant about some mathematical finance topics. I posted about Futures before (right when CBOE launched), so I thought it would make sense to formalize a discussion about derivatives. My personal favorite is deriving the price of a simple Vanilla (European) Option, so I’ll take a stab at that today...

First things first... what is an Option. Well, an option is a contract between two parties: Person A would like to buy an asset (the underlying) for some price (the strike) at a future time (at maturity). However, the key aspect is that this contract gives one the option to buy, there is no obligation on behalf of the option holder, whereas the option seller is forced to oblige. This option contract can either be an option to buy the underlying, generally referred to as a call option, or to sell the underlying, generally referred to as a put option.

Now, when you enter into a contract of say a call/put option, your counterparty is entering a short-call/put, i.e. they are shorting a call/put option, while you are entering a long-call/put, i.e. you are longing a call/put.

At maturity, call it T, (the time-point in the future where you can exercise the right to buy/sell), the value of the call/put is simple. For example, for a call of strike price K:

If the value of the underlying S at time T (S_T) is above the strike price, the call option is valued at V_T = S_T - K > 0. This is what is commonly referred to as “in-the-money”. And if the price of the underlying S_T is less than the strike K, i.e. S_T < K, then the call option is worthless, that is V_T = 0.

So, the value of the call option at maturity is max(S_T - K, 0) = (S_T - K)^+.

The derivation of the formula for the put option is left to the reader as an exercise ;)

Now, since the long call/put give you the option to buy/sell with no obligation to do so, it would make no sense for your counterparty to enter this contract for free. Why would they... they can only ever lose money (when the option is in-the-money) or get nothing (when the option is out-of-the-money).

As my good friend Lt. Aldo Rain said: “When it sound too good to be true, it ain’t”

Ok, so obviously options have a price. At maturity their price is exactly V_T as we derived above. But what is the price of an option at time t < T, that is, what is V_t for t < T?

This is actually not an easy question to answer, and it took a few decades before the right argument was found. First, there was a very simple model, commonly known as the CRR model or Binomial options pricing model (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model), which relied on finding a risk-free martingale measure (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-neutral_measure) on the space of random walks of a binomial tree. This was the “state-of-the-art” for a few years until mathematicians Fisher Black and Myron Scholes gave a mathematical proof for the “fair” price of an option on an underlying that satisfied some basic mathematical assumptions (which we will get to in a second). This proof got them the Nobel Prize in economics (actually only Myron Scholes was awarded because poor Mr. Black died before he received it), and put them up there with the greats like John Forbes Nash, Robert C Merton and William F Sharpe.

Ok, so how does one derive the price of V_t for t < T, given that we know the payoff diagram of V_T as a function of S_T, the price of the underlying at maturity? Recall that for instance for a call it’s V_T(S_T) = max( S_T - K, 0 ). Please note at this point that technically, V is a function of both time and the price of the underlying. I’m just writing V_T(...) to mean V(T, ...) and V_T(S_T) = V(T,S_T)

Well, the beautiful thing is that the answer to this question is: It’s the solution to a differential equation! Read at the bottom if you don’t know what a differential equation is.

The argument is quite simple:

Let us assume that the return of the underlying follow the following equation

dS/S = u dt + s dW

That is, the rate of return dS/S of our underlying for some infinitesimal time-period (that tends to zero) has some deterministic component u dt (the trend or drift) and some random component s dW (the volatility), where this random component follows a normal distribution (which is a fine assumption based on the law of large numbers). 

If we accept this underlying assumption (most people have proven it’s bullshit, but this rant is about mathematical proofs and not empirical evidence), then we can compute the expected value and Variance of our stochastic process dS/S:

E[ dS/S ] = u dt

E[ (dS/S)^2 ] = s^2 dt

If you don’t know what a stochastic process, expected value or Variance is, google it. You should know it if you’re older than 21...

Since the payoff of the option at maturity is known (it’s V_T), we can compute what is called a stochastic Taylor expansion of dS/S via something called Ito’s Lemma. The proof of Ito’s Lemma is pretty easy... just google it.

Then, we arrive at:

dV= (u S dV/dS + dV/dT + 1/2 s^2 S^2 d^2 V/dS^2) dt + s S dV/dS dW

Ok, now that we have this, we need to somehow make most of this 0. The part in front of the dW after the dt is pretty irrelevant because it’s random and has an expected value of 0 (since dW is a Wiener process... again, google it)

It’s the part in the brackets we care about. Now, to prove that we can derive a formula, we want to formulate an arbitrage argument, so assume you are short one Option (the one you are trying to price) and long dV/dS (some number) shares at time t < T.

So what is the value of this portfolio? Lets call it TT (like in Wilipedia). The value is obviously the value of your long position ( dV/dS * S ) plus the value of your short position ( -V ). Why? Well, we shorted one option, whose value at time t we denoted as V_t (and we drop the t for simplicity) and we are long exactly dV/dS = c (some number) of shares that are worth S_t by assumption (drop the t for simplicity). Note that this is commonly referred to as a delta hedge.

So

TT = -V + dV/dS S

If we now only look at infinitesimal changes in V and S

dTT = -dV + dV/dS dS ( = 0... sorta)

Plug in our formulas for dS/S and dV:

dS = u S dt + s S dW

dV= (u S dV/dS + dV/dT + 1/2 s^2 S^2 d^2  V/dS^2 ) dt + s S dV/dS dW

Plug it into dTT and get

dTT = (- dV/dt - 1/2 s^2 S^2 d^2 V/dS^2 ) dt

Check wikipedia here for a better derivation (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_equation)

Notice that the random component is gone (this is the most important part to understand), which means that the option price has no randomness anymore. Hence, the price can be computed regardless of future randomness (which we assume we can not predict)

Now, here comes the arbitrage argument. The value of our position TT is some number (some amount if money it cost us to open that position), and if we were completely risk-averse, we could have put that money into the bank and gotten some risk-free rate of return, call it r. The arbitrage argument is that the “value” of the delta hedge (which is provably risk-free) must be the same as the value of the cost of the hedge given the risk-free rate of return over some infinitesimal time-period, i.e.

r TT = dTT/dt (or equivalently) r dt TT = dTT

Plug in the formula for TT and dTT on both sides and arrive at

dV/dT + 1/2 s^2 S^2 d^2 V/d^2 S + r S dV/dS - rV = 0

Boom! There you go... Black Scholes equation for deriving the price of an option, assuming the the return rate follows a Stochastic Ordinary Differential Equation with drift u and volatility s.

#Note: I do these things for fun. I really like to do them. This was the first finance oriented one, but let me know if you prefer the Crypto ones. I can do either...

Technical Notes:

Notice how this looks just like the heat equation (
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) with time inversion.

In fact, the equation is a special form of the heat equation that describes how heat dissipates over time on a circular metallic ring. Mind = blown. When I first read this (back when I was 19) it blew my mind. I kept coming back to it and realizing the elegance and beauty in it. I still get goose bumps thinking about it.

Ok, but some of you don’t know what a differential equation is, I assume. So quick digression:

A (linear ordinary) differential equation is a an equation of functions that accept functions as arguments. The simplest differential equation is:

f’ = f (or, equivalently) f’ - f = 0

What does this mean? Well, the argument to the equation (the unknown variable is f, some function), and the prime (‘) is an operator known as the derivative operator (technically this is a functional). You can also write this operator as d/dx, making the formula above:

d/dx( f ) - f = 0

Treat f as your “unknown”, and try to solve this equation. You will see that there are infinitely many solutions to this equation, all of which are of the form:

f_c(x) = e^( x + c )

Why? Well, the derivative of this function is simply itself, and hence f’ - f = 0 for all f = f_c and any c in the real numbers. The proof is left to the reader as an exercise.

Now, some of you have seen this before, but in order to properly derive the formula for an option price at time t < T, we need to understand partial derivatives... if a function has two arguments (like space and time), then we can compute the derivative of that function with respect to space and time respectively. You can even compute the second derivative with respect to both space and time... and these derivatives commute. If you have any questions about this, feel free to let me know."

IMO the aformentioned two points regardless of price have always been the strengths of District0x.  

It use to drive me mad the lack of marketing and the reluctance to speculate on price. As a holder I wanted to know why the token was going up or down in value.

It was the right approach though, look at Tronix, EMC2, verge etc. the people behind them coming out with ""mind blowing announcement,"" ""Huge partnership being announced"" etc. pumpimg the price up only to eventually produce severely underwhelming news. The District0x team go about there business quietly and this is annoying at times for money hungry hodlers (Including me) but deep down we all know it is the best approach.

Most coins do not give you an economic interest, either they are BTC clones or a token forced into a business model for the sake of having a token (i.e. SNT).

 >When selling Bitcoin, who is being processed first?
If I was selling 1000 BTC and the other person only 10, would the BTC be bought from me or the other person first?
Or am I supposed to wait until someone wants to buy exactly how much I want to sell?"

8141,1515173121.0,"Thank you for your views. I agree it's silly season, and my understanding of technicals and fundamentals hurt when I see the «penny stocks» of crypto increase their value left and right - perhaps largely caused by new money wanting their XRP to go to $20 000 like BTC. Several friends of mine are borderline retarded when it comes to finances, and went balls balls deep in trx and ada because they'd have «thousands of coins». I wont go in detail, but just believe me when I say they have no clue what's going on. 

I believe 2018-19 will be years of slaughter, as many ICO's and upcoming projects actually have deadlines they gotta deliver to. I'm putting my money in projects that may survive this, leading to a considerable percentage of my portfolio being OmiseGO. It's still a bet - but if they manage to pull it of we might be part of a hugely disrupting technology, actually impacting many people across countries. 

Anyways, I'm on my way to start rambling - I should get back to work. Hope to see more analyses from you. Welcome on board souvlaki! :)"
8142,1515173122.0,Can anyone care to explain the correlation between BTC rising and Alt coins dropping? New to this and trying to get the most information I can.
8143,1515173133.0,Parity does that.

8145,1515173144.0,"Altcoins there is everything to play for. Well worth keeping a bit in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is currently in a correctional stage, who knows how long and how far for. But Bitcoin could go down to 10,000 USD or maybe 8000 USD. When it goes down and gets flat, that's the time to get in on Bitcoin and just hodl it forever."

Iv got a few thousand Tron and its blowing up - who a dog game would be so popular lmao. Gonna look into this because its better to invest in a working product than speculation imo"
8151,1515173181.0,"BTC rallies are strong because lots of traders use BTC pairs. When stop losses hit, that is more BTC getting bought. So it doesn't take much of a push for BTC to push upwards. Hopefully one day exchanges and traders will turn their backs on accumulating BTC and use ETH instead. I myself have BTC for trading and my stop losses buy back BTC.. it's unfortunately where the volume is at this point in time. "

8158,1515173229.0,"Honestly it looks like the pool shat the bed. I don't think there is a scam. I believe buddy running the pool is legit (twistedchaos) however I do know that he has been having some medical issues lately. For the time being I have switched to mining other coins that I already mine, and will continue to mine with usxmr as soon as its back up. It is inconvenient, but too early to say 'shitty, small scam pool' as someone else did. We all start out small in the beginning."

8177,1515173450.0,Less than parity with BTC for all of 2018.
8178,1515173480.0,Rooting for BTC here. I'm sick of seeing all those random coins getting pumped with no actual reason. Bring the money back home 
8179,1515173486.0,"If we use the dot com bubbleas a model, then what we'll see is a market where everything goes up an apparently stupid amount. Then the burst will happen, the shit (pets.com/cardano) dies and the strong (Amazon/Monero) crashes. But the shit is then dead forever, and the  strong will recover to heights the like of which we never thought possible even during the bubble.

Look at Amazon's 20 year price chart to see this happening.

We're in for a rough ride, but if you've got good technology, then I believe that will eventually determine the survivors. And the survivors will be such incredible successes. But short term we're going to have to put up with pets.coin getting huge funding when we know it shouldn't.
